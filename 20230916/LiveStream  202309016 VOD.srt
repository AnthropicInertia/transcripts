1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I just spent the whole day pretty much bringing up my age-old blog site.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Last I had worked on it was I had moved it to 11ty because I wanted a good enough markdown to a good enough more text-focused site.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then I have been trying, what I've been saying that I want to get back to writing.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So there was something very small happened at work so I started working with these people because it was the end of the project.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And one of the things that we are currently doing is figuring out deployment plans.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:31,000
One of that was versioning strategy and I was like, at least let me write whatever we decided there because where it began was it started as a small tweet on Mastodon trying to just write the format that I had decided.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then I needed to write another paragraph. Then I exceeded Mastodon's text limit. Should I break it down into multiple posts?

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
At this point, it makes sense to just write it in markdown on that blasted site where I have not made updates in years and put it there.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then when I went to put it there, I first did it. It's connected to Versel so you need your deployment.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then I log into Versel and I see a bunch of build failures. Sorry, sorry, it did not go through. It got blocked so I logged into Versel and I saw build failures.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And turned out it was set to Node.js 12. So Versel has deprecated Node 12. So this entire day was that thread.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then it was, I have done this, I have done that. I might as well sit with the recording and start writing.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, now that I have written, I might as well put it on the website. Now that I have put it on the website, I might as well do this.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that's what I was doing till 1758.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Actually good, pretty good.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We are live. So yeah, I also have to do something very similar and I have written more, I started writing more amount of microblogging frameworks than actually blogging.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Every time I come up with this, this one doesn't fit me, I need to write something. There are so many names, FLOG.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The last one was named FLOG.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But yeah, I appreciate somebody at least putting things out there instead of just doing the procrastination behind it.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Even just for five years.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But what I mean is today is a historic day, even if it is the only historic day for the next four years.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Makes sense, makes sense.

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I was thinking about what you said and kind of trying to build up the idea.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So here's a thought. We have the right ideas, we do the right things, but don't, like we get, because we are too early to the party, we get lukewarm feedback about it.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we don't stick around when the party actually kicks in.

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We kind of, before that, shit this sucks and I'm going to go home and we just leave for home.

27
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That ends up happening.

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't have to explain that part, right? You agree that happens.

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now if we explain it will be for the audience and for the record, like FDR.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So I'll come back to the explanation part.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like when those things happen, Applet is a good enough example, the AI, the things that we predict, this is where things will go.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
These are the things we should build that also includes like, what do you call it?

33
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The online communication platforms, Groupone and all, like very efficiently adopting WebRTC, seeing the potential in it.

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All those things, we did it early, did it in advance.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It actually struck a chord with people who cared, but not with the mass.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It was not sustainable in that sense, that it wouldn't generate revenue immediately.

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But instead of sticking out with that, we kind of like, ah, people just don't understand, let's do something else that is fun and interesting.

38
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We kind of went through the loop of that.

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was thinking that that might again be the case, unless we are being mindful about it.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And this is a platform where, first time in human history, people are actually having discussions or interactive way of communicating.

41
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just basically not just one to many kind of communication, which has been the entire history.

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Somebody tells you something and you do it, instead of that.

43
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now, I think my audio was still pretty screwed up.

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So now, through those podcasts, audio books, like the comments in the video platforms, as well as the response videos like on TikTok and everything,

45
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
there's like interactivity between where people are getting their information from and sharing it, bouncing it right back at them.

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And that is happening. That is actually huge from a potential perspective, from seeing a potential like what matters, right?

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
First time somebody like marked something on a card, something on a rock, it was not something that like it was not profound.

48
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It was not really something that you would frame it and put it on a wall.

49
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But it is something that you would frame it and put it on the wall for the sheer potential of transcending information through time.

50
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Similarly, the discussion platforms that are happening that is like not one-dimensional, bidirectional discussion that is happening,

51
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,000
people communicating with the podcasters and stuff, that is going into a direction where I see a lot of people are setting up the base,

52
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
creating that ecosystem, which we can leverage from and bring in the discussions that people are yet not having.

53
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We are having these discussions and we also think that, oh, maybe people are not interested about it or people are probably not going to understand it or whatever that is.

54
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But instead of doing that, how about we give our best shot at making it available and whatever happens, happens.

55
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:56,000
My hypothesis is if we stick around with that and spend a good enough amount of building the backlog of what are the things that we want to talk about,

56
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
what are the things that we have at hand and the practice of it, then at some point when people have discovered it are coming along for the journey,

57
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:16,000
we will have a solid repository of stuff to show as well as solid grasp on the presentation of the topics as well.

58
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And we can take it somewhere. It can become more than what it is now.

59
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
With that said, what are you thinking about this? Quick thought, it was just like I was thinking about half an hour before.

60
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So this is a pattern that I anyway have found and I totally agree that the challenge with our work hasn't been really that we don't have interesting things to work on.

61
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But I just want to say two things. One is my experience this morning, what I just narrated, how I got into fixing the site.

62
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The only thing we need to do is look at something long enough, the way change, the way we trigger change or we work.

63
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sorry, that's like my cat's fur getting into the fans.

64
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Basically, the way we have worked is if we look at something long enough, start seeing the cracks, start seeing the gaps in that and then we would like to fix that.

65
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So this entire journey with Applet has been exactly that.

66
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But the problem was that there were too many things to fix and we were like falling through the rabbit hole, not hitting the bottom.

67
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
By the time we hit the bottom, it kind of timed out. It was time to go home at that point and many other things at the same time.

68
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But the point is that bottom, that journey, when I look back at that, there is a certain deconstructionist approach that I'm applying to that memory.

69
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That how did we go? Where did we go? It was as if the quest to where it landed on unicorn, really, which was kind of breaking down to a certain set of fundamentals.

70
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I think that part is still valid as an area of research, as an area of research.

71
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But the second thing here is that I have been already watching the last two videos that we have recorded.

72
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This being chapter three in this discussion, and I see us intentionally or unintentionally overlapping topics, like the same things that we had discussed last time, that comes in through another area.

73
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So if I was to archive this, what I found was there is one, of course, a narrative of as we spoke in the order of things.

74
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But then if I blend that into like an encyclopedia or a knowledge base, so to say, by broad questions and topics, it turns out that we have a lot to say over time about the same thing.

75
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And aggregating that would be very interesting.

76
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So what I want to do really is with these discussions, I want to pipe this through to first us like speech to text engine, populate the basic.

77
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And I mean, it's semi-intelligent speech to text, not just basic Python speech to text.

78
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But that is where the AI part comes in.

79
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The link that I shared with you, I had only gone through chapter one.

80
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And as I kept on listening, I was also listening to last week's recording yesterday.

81
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was like, wait, didn't we discuss on day two and I'm watching day one?

82
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then I went to day two and it seemed like in day two, we have discussed everything about the topic, except the part that was touched on day one with some just common bridges, which means there is value in creating this union of sets.

83
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And these topics are emerging.

84
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What I mean to say is that whatever we repeat, whatever beers repeating in our discussions is something that we want to get back to.

85
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And those should be the topics, which brings me back to that loop that I had said on the first chapter that if we are looping, then that is worth recording.

86
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And that itself then goes on to form broader discussions.

87
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So I totally agree in the sense that I think in the future, let's say even a year down the line, we could be looking at what we have done and trace it back to something like chapter two, chapter three, chapter four of the discussions to find that pathway.

88
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is good. We just follow where curiosity is leading at this point.

89
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think it's naturally emerging in a very nice way.

90
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So when it's a curiosity time and whatever spark.

91
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I, so in that sense, let's not rush into packaging it and packaging is in sense like to make it something of a brand or anything immediately.

93
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's go through the same process that we are doing right now with some patterns will emerge.

94
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What you're talking about like the horizontal and the vertical interpretation of the things like we're talking about, like having a chronological.

95
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, we talked about these things today that think to the day after.

96
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But also, if we look at from the perpendicular view, we talked about this part of this topic this day, and that part that day, and combine that as the topical discussion part.

97
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So I have a wiki deployment. If that helps, if you want to also interpose as in, what do you call it, make it topical in that way order that also can work that way.

98
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, I think that is phase two anyway.

99
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, I see. Cool.

100
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Where was I going with this?

101
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So, I was talking about how, where was I going with this?

102
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think I had a thought and it vanished. It popped.

103
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay, forget it for the time being.

104
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I think I understand what you're saying. I agree. Let the pattern emerge naturally.

105
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, the other part of it was about the speech to text part we talked about, right?

106
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Speech to text, yes. So, there are a couple of services.

107
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
None of them are very cheap, cheap enough, as in, but...

108
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I mean, I would measure it in my time, right? I mean, at this point, if I take three hours to get to a transcript, what is the cost of my three hours worth of work? I have a very clear idea.

109
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think it's more than that. If so, I'm willing to try.

110
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It costs in thousands of minutes, and it's going to be $0.1 or something like that per session, ideally, something like that.

111
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, I mean, anything under 15-20 is good enough.

112
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Exactly. So, the better ones would be Assembly AI and second would be Deepgram.

113
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And if we don't want all of that, if we just can run...

114
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Do you have a GPU right now? Yes. So, which one did you get? Did you get the Intel Arc or did you get the...

115
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I have a 4060. Okay. So, in that case, also, it's an RTS GPU. You can run the models.

116
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, those server services are also running, actually, the Whisper, the OpenAI Whisper.

117
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So, if you run OpenAI Whisper, the JAX version, so I'll send you the details, right?

118
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So, in that case, you can just basically run it on your system and get the result.

119
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, so, I wanted to use the same opportunity to also learn at the same time.

120
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The reason I created that space on my blog was I'm now like, I want this to be filled in this format, except I don't want to be doing it.

121
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I want a script, help somebody do it.

122
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But there was another pattern that I noticed by watching the last two recordings.

123
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And that is compared to the last times we discussed this, there is a lot of higher order maturity in our thinking, because we have spent more time, both you and I.

124
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Like earlier, what used to be vague jumps across the chasm, now they are like very well identified landing points and like we have traced.

125
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So, what I mean is that certain things are very well formed and putting them together will probably be quicker than, let's say, it was last time.

126
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What I again want to do is make sure that those inflection points are captured.

127
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's very much like watching two galaxies merge.

128
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's kind of that dance. You know it won't clash, it will just flow through each other.

129
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The important thing is locking around that, like what you had said as twin stars orbiting.

130
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I think it is looking like two galaxies currently merging and would then begin orbiting.

131
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So, yeah, so last day we started talking about something.

132
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you want to continue with that or do you have some other topics in mind?

133
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
OK, let's try to go for that. By the way, I posted the link about the whisperjacks.

134
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So, if you can run it on your system, I think you will get the transcriptions for free, essentially.

135
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Right, cool.

136
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, I was trying to make a criticism about dialectics, as in the entire process of dialectic, the dialectic process itself.

137
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I was not able to put a finger on exactly where my discomfort comes from,

138
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but finally I realized it from a concept called PID controllers.

139
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Did I expand on this? I didn't.

140
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
OK, so let me share my screen then.

141
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Can you see it?

142
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I can't hear you, so you have to say yes or no.

143
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I can see, I can see.

144
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
OK, fine.

145
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So, this is a controller theory that is used pretty much everywhere.

146
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You are trying to stick a landing, essentially, frankly speaking.

147
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That includes the previous attempt of landing the Chandrayaan-2, essentially, the rover.

148
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, point being, there are three aspects to that control theory.

149
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
One is the proportionality control, second is the integral control, and third is the derivative control.

150
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What do they do?

151
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm not going to the maths part of it, just keeping it very straightforward and visual interpretive.

152
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So, if you are trying to get somewhere, the intent of going there is, let's say, higher when you are not there,

153
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
further away from that position, the set point you are.

154
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, let's say, for example, this is your initial position.

155
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This blue marker is your set point where you want to go.

156
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Further away you are, the more intention that you have to get there.

157
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But as closer you go, you have less and less intensity to get there,

158
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
because if you keep that intensity, you will cross over, right?

159
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You will just shoot through.

160
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So, you have to reduce that proportionally.

161
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's the proportionality part.

162
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You can identify that as an echo chamber.

163
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This is the thesis part.

164
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Now, there's a drawback to that only using proportionality.

165
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
As closer it gets, there's a paradox with that as well.

166
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It says you cannot reach the other end of the room diagonally,

167
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:02,000
because the arrow does not reach the target, because it has to get to the halfway point,

168
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and then the halfway point, etc.

169
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
When actually you reach the other end, you never reach.

170
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So, that actually happens mathematically here.

171
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You asymptotically approach it, keep on approaching it, you never reach it.

172
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So, in order to challenge that, you need a mechanism

173
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that looks back at what the date is, the date it needs to pay,

174
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and then it drives the proportionality up in order to reach that goal.

175
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's the integral part.

176
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What it does is that it continuously checks how far behind we are from reaching the target,

177
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and it keeps on adding an extra term to it.

178
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So, the second part of that.

179
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So, when you are getting closer, the proportionality of this value becomes smaller.

180
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This value takes over.

181
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The challenge there is the integral part does not have a self-correction mechanism for itself.

182
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So, what ends up happening is that it shoots through, goes to the other end,

183
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
then basically has to come back again, because that part of self-correction is there.

184
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So, when it realizes that, hey, I'm way off,

185
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
when the latency of looking back catches that, hey, I'm way off,

186
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that's when it tries to self-correct itself and tries to go back.

187
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But it results in a harmonic, as in oscillation, like it's basically a ringing,

188
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
where it never, again, it does not reach the set point.

189
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It oscillates around the set point because it always has some amount of delta time

190
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to look back on to identify that, hey, I need the correction, I need to correct myself.

191
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's where the derivative, so by the way, this integral term, you can look at it as the antithesis,

192
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
the term that tries to correct the proportionality, the echo chamber,

193
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
by bringing in the counter-argument and fixing the part.

194
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The only thing is that there's also the exact same kind of latency that gets in.

195
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And that's the part we actually talked about before,

196
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
is that we always end up overdoing any kind of social changes that needs to happen

197
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
when the discussion comes in, in a generation or half,

198
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
we basically overdo it and then we have to, again, go the other direction a little bit.

199
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So, that's what ends up happening with integral term.

200
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Now, what to do about this?

201
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Another way to approach this is that the derivative term.

202
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So, the derivative term approaches in a way that it has very little to no effect at all when starting,

203
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
but it checks for the delta it needs to reach around the set point and dampens the response,

204
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:16,000
sorry, basically the value by adding or subtracting the corrective term, that is, look ahead.

205
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So, as integral part was look back, like how much we have not achieved what we should have,

206
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and adding it to it, derivative terms like how much, how strongly are we gonna cross the set point

207
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and dampening the response by that, and if that is not the case, then letting it happen.

208
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Like, go fast if you are not approaching, but slow down if we are approaching that point.

209
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
In that sense, what it does, it basically helps us stick that landing.

210
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Depending on the values, you still have that not, this animation would be kind of appropriate to see how it ends up happening.

211
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
There are more. So, basically what ends up happening in the ideal state is it goes straight like this,

212
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
asymptotically kind of gets closer and then touches it, and depending on the parametric values,

213
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you get the landing, how closely it sticks the landing, right.

214
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So, hopefully that made some sense. I'm not sure how much it came out in the diagram.

215
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:41,000
My point is, we don't have the third aspect in our, what would be an umbrella term for what dialectics is about,

216
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
or what dialectics tries to fix.

217
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So, that part, this would be the third part that we need to add, which I'm calling it the hypothesis part,

218
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
which is look ahead, where do you want to stick the landing, looking ahead for that,

219
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and then correcting the other two sides of things like thesis and antithesis,

220
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
gets corrected by the hypothesis and then sticks the landing, where it needs to be.

221
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So, there are lots of like, I don't have worked for a lot of things, maybe because I didn't do enough reading about it.

222
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is kind of an original thought. So, I need a lot of supporting elements to build it up into a theory.

223
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm done saying the things that I wanted to say. I am looking for the criticism on this part.

224
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, I'm not sure you're going to get much in the way of criticism as much as a critique.

225
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So, I do think, so when I said landing, I pretty much had something similar in mind,

226
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
though not, this is a good mathematical demonstration of what I was talking about.

227
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And now I realize what you said last day when you said that hypothesis is the thing that's missing.

228
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, that connects back. And I do agree that in the sense that if we are to plot the rate of change of topic,

229
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
which is also what I was saying, that if we look long enough at something,

230
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
so what is worth looking long enough if something is appearing in the vision, then stay with it, slow down your approach,

231
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and then invariably you're going to overshoot it a bit, then come back and land.

232
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So, I think that there are multiple hypotheses on which I think we both are operating.

233
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
At least that is what I meant by a certain higher order thinking that has already happened.

234
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Sorry, the reason we are not shooting off target really is that some of those targets far enough or fundamental enough have been identified.

235
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So, I think it's a matter of letting down some of those hypotheses,

236
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:17,000
then discovering the hypothesis or articulating the hypothesis would probably be the primary focus of these discussions

237
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
each time with the aim to land the hypothesis in that sense.

238
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So, your hypothesis is the blue mark and in the process some things will be things that we'll find solved.

239
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Hypothesis is not the blue mark. If you go back to Hegelian interpretation,

240
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the reason he came up with this is that the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Trinity,

241
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
he was trying to kind of symbolize the Trinity, which also Freud did with Ego, Superego and all these things.

242
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So, that was kind of something everybody was trying to connect back with the theology of that time,

243
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,000
which I already identified or symbolized that there's a Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and they form the Trinity.

244
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:22,000
From Hegel's interpretation, he said those three things like the thesis, antithesis and synthesis were those three things.

245
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:35,000
My point is that's not. The synthesis is the Trinity and the Spirit has to be the hypothesis.

246
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The Son is the Id or the Son is the proportionality, the Father is the antithesis or the superego.

247
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But the thing that lands the landing, that is the hypothesis part, that you need, that's the Spirit, that's the ego,

248
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that's the part you need to land. And overall, they connect back as a Trinity. Overall, they connect back as the synthesis.

249
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So synthesis is not complete without the hypothesis. What ends up happening is that we have not integrated that as a process.

250
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:29,000
In our, even till contemporary, we kind of look down on somebody hypothesizing something as you don't have solid data for it, right?

251
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
My point is solid data is only possible as an option for looking back, that integral aspect of things.

252
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
For you, if you want to stick the landing and not overdo anything, not do the damage, the only way to do that is look ahead.

253
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And for that matter, you cannot have solid data. You need to have the differential part aspect of the thing.

254
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So which is where the third aspect, the Spirit or whichever way you want to interpret is, that needs to happen.

255
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So the overall thing comes as the Trinity. Overall, that comes up as the synthesis.

256
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But I think that those three things, that parts of the Trinity are that thesis, antithesis and the hypothesis.

257
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Together they make the synthesis, or together they should make the synthesis, which is much more nuanced than the previous approach.

258
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I mean, in some sense, we are talking epistemology, so why not?

259
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I should read this, as in I haven't gone through this.

260
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So the epistemology that you would find in some of those Eastern traditions breaks down those concepts into further stages of proof.

261
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So you look at Buddhist epistemology, you look at Nyaya epistemology, Shankar epistemology.

262
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Shankar is probably the one who simplifies it in some sense, but it's Doito.

263
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So it talks of two materials, which tries one nation, one election kind of strategy.

264
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Everything is one. But Nyaya does this very interesting thing where it was a practice.

265
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Now why I shared this, as opposed to Hegelian dialectic, is they are talking about the same things.

266
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:52,000
These are very, very strong similarities. But these were traditions who ceremonized their usual exchanges.

267
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
These were philosophies born out of people actually discussing, questioning each other, coming to the truth.

268
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That is where Torco comes from. As it happens, if you look at the list,

269
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:15,000
stage number eight of the 16 categories is called Torco or hypothetical slash suppositional reasoning.

270
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So Torco Corona is basically somebody says don't hypothesize. If you hypothesize, you are already on stage eight.

271
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're not far enough from actually achieving knowledge.

272
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But these were basically the 16 categories. Now what these categories mean will leave that to coming outside of this entire thing.

273
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But if you just scroll down a bit, like the overall epistemology, that you have perception,

274
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and within which you have determinate, indeterminate, then you have onuman, so inference.

275
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And these systems also standardize in some sense or formalize certain lines of inquiry that Western philosophy just ignores as voodoo.

276
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But turns out there is enough, enough details in this schools of knowledge.

277
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And you will find yourself very familiar with those. All it struck me when I read the first demo that this is how they have categorized.

278
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I know all of these sensations. It's like they have presented me a curated, ordered structure to that exact chaos.

279
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Now of this, these are like these are degrees of formation of knowledge. So Proman, which is the strongest.

280
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So it says that before perception, inference is not as strong, but good enough.

281
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Then you have upoman, which is comparison, which is, again, not that analogy, which is what you get to if you can't infer.

282
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Then you have shop, though, which is testimony somebody else's words.

283
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But the interesting thing is you can start this process outside in.

284
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And if you then look at these three stages, you kind of again reach that sort of Trinity, because the hypothetical reasoning happens when you are discussing or when you are like that is where the dialectic comes in.

285
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So hegel's hegelian dialectic and torco in there are kind of the other things you would apply to get to that hypothetical supposition.

286
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But all I'm saying is that you're on the right track. This is and that was a bit patronizing.

287
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But you're on the right track in the sense that I would just say that hegel is good.

288
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Keep this on the other side and and keep the Buddhist epistemology on the other side, because what that says at its fundamental nature is you got to try things to believe it.

289
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But if you don't get to try, what do you do?

290
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You have to assume you have to imagine.

291
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So basically, these all are people.

292
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
If you read those treatises, you find these people sitting randomly and asking what if questions.

293
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Very little resource, which is why like my respect kind of goes out and goes for those people who have thought about these things with so little resources.

294
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Because they couldn't have for the even the best they tried.

295
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They couldn't have known all the other things that have happened, all the other people who are thinking the same terms.

296
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So I kind of feel that we are so lucky that I can have a day job and also like do this for fun.

297
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Right. Which is insane.

298
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
For many people, they had to live their life as essentially the way of living in order to even get any anywhere closer to this.

299
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Which is also like I should not take this for granted, but yeah, it opens up.

300
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But there is an earlier of that life.

301
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I came to that. So this was my thought when I first studied this.

302
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And this was for second year, sorry, first year, second semester of philosophy.

303
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And my first thought was these people built so much exactly these words without so little.

304
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And this was 2009. And I was like, if they had the technology today.

305
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So we'll keep on saying this. But then as I learned more, I realized that these technologies, these are technologies to the point of understanding knowledge.

306
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You apply these things to a knowledge based to creating a knowledge system.

307
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And you don't have to be a product manager. These people have been your product managers.

308
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You just let it implement what they're saying in these stages.

309
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And because they work with such small data window, their computation is very resource conservative, not wasteful at all, essentially.

310
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Which means the computations have been broken, broken, broken down to their smallest forms where they are understandable, then logically build up as a foundational system and highly technically interconnected sets of work.

311
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So basically, I'm saying they were the product managers like epistemology is product management of knowledge.

312
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah, I see that. I see that. I see that form, essentially.

313
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And I think one of the things I one of the hypothesis that I have been operating on is what what framework these people had created can be implemented using the technology that we have today.

314
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Without the individual, because a lot of this practice then went on to the Sadaq.

315
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So you don't then have to be the Sadaq. You can if you can outsource, you know, to the Babas that you have always wanted to outsource these decisions to.

316
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Why not just like try a different Baba, a Baba that actually understands these things has been built with some like these technologies in mind.

317
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But anyway, going too vague, what I mean is that I believe it is possible to build a knowledge base that employs these systems of knowledge and then, you know, build those views.

318
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So given the same set of events, can I have a Hegelian dialectic view of the events?

319
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Can I have a new view of the events, which are just different queries, different structured queries producing different kinds of data structures out of the same fundamental thing that you were seeing?

320
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I am also seeing which is the nature around them.

321
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Right. So that way, this is those all those previous prior works, they're basically stepping stones to go forward, go further.

322
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Right. Absolutely. Yeah.

323
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So that's how I'm seeing it. There are lots of these, these things, all these things should be kind of kept as like, okay, in the Appendices or the References section that, hey, this builds on top of these things.

324
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
In order to go forward, you cannot just have a solution and as a capsule and just eat it.

325
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Basically, if you understand what are the parts it builds on top of, that gives you a better mileage.

326
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So I think all the prior attempts, because the best they could do is build in the present by looking at the past.

327
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That was the best approach that they could have taken, like very definitively, because we have to identify this thing as well.

328
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What we are doing now is taking over of the derivative part.

329
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Think about because we're closer to the set point. That's when the derivative takes up, like picks up the pace, because that's where it starts mattering more.

330
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Right.

331
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So we are bringing in that part.

332
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And so far it hasn't been used as much because so far that that part of the equation was very miniscule and ignorable.

333
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
More what mattered mattered was the proportionality and the backlog of like, hey, we need to fix this thing.

334
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Now, where to get to, we have a very closer view of because we are kind of reaching that.

335
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If for the lack of a better set point, let's say superintelligence is the set point that we are looking at.

336
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We are kind of approaching that closely enough that we need to if we don't stick the landing.

337
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There are a lot of people are talking about what the dangers that like involved with that.

338
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So point is now it starts mattering.

339
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now we are bringing that aspect, that part of the equation up and try to stick the landing.

340
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't see the previous approach as the wrong or false or something.

341
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's just at that point, that's the best they could have done.

342
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And at that point, those two are the things that mattered more.

343
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Now that we're starting to matter the other way, let's make it more comprehensive and use the other term.

344
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I just want to destigmatize the usage of hypothesis because if you look at it from even a school or childhood,

345
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
like if or even especially in we are data driven, whenever people say that,

346
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
what they're trying to nullify or invalidate is that somebody who is pitching an idea

347
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that they don't yet have solid data for and to demotivate them from going ahead and gathering the solid data for it.

348
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Right. So that's what ends up happening.

349
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I want to destigmatize that part, that aspect of the entire discourse when that happens.

350
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And overall, push it out into the system like the general side search or whatever you call it.

351
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Is that the pronunciation?

352
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:11,000
To make everybody come to the conclusion that, hey, it is from temporal perspective,

353
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
we cannot only look at the present and the past.

354
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Future matters just as much because the other parts of the discussion that we'll eventually come to,

355
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
where if you look at the actualization of the universe, it basically is a temporal loop in a sense.

356
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's like a rubber band. Where is the ending?

357
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You cannot find where the ending or the beginning is if you start seeing the whole thing as a temporal loop.

358
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So it is relevant to be mindful about the whole directionality,

359
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the spline of time and not only just look back on one direction.

360
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah. Right.

361
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So this is one of the topics that I want to kind of like build upon.

362
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm pretty sure like we touched on this like two episodes like last time I talked about this.

363
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
This time I'm showing some of the data about this.

364
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm pretty sure that there will be more terms and all those things that I will come up with and start enriching this particular topic.

365
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This is going to be one of the topics.

366
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Yeah. So let's put a pin on that and move forward with other things that we may want to talk about.

367
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I have a lot of other things, but do you have anything else to talk about this?

368
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I think this deserves a bit more elaboration just for the sake of.

369
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes, what happened?

370
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
My headphone decides to go to sleep from time to time. It's grown old. It's like I have to go to sleep.

371
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I don't think you are speaking through as in the mic change.

372
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Essentially, the mic source changed.

373
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah, should be better now.

374
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah, it had I had reconnected, but it has switched back.

375
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yes. Anyway, I was saying that this topic deserves a bit more elaboration.

376
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Therefore, we move on to others because there is some fundamental that this connects to to what I have been working towards and thinking.

377
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And it's sort of right this time, right?

378
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So the hypothesis that I mentioned that it should be possible to take some of these tools for mass consumption.

379
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And when I say mass consumption, let me rephrase that.

380
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I mean, regular consumption for myself and to those I want to share the information with.

381
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm looking at the inside out network.

382
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And for the same reasons that atoms form, then connect and the connecting force being a sort of gravity.

383
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So what I see this possible like being possible to do is pretty much the same thing that if you look at Automarge, that local first project.

384
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In some sense, my approach to knowledge management is kind of similar to their approach to dev tooling, where they say that if developers have built enough tools to make their life easier, software developers specifically,

385
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
the sort of debugging and things that don't exist for other technical professions.

386
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Besides software design, because we use line based things and their premises to bring the same kind of things that clearly serve some small people are benefiting out of implementing within their domain,

387
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:10,000
bring those concepts and apply to a set of baseline fundamental tools that can also apply to other domains of creative work.

388
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And what I'm trying to say here is that I feel like my approach to I mean, they have explained it in a certain ways.

389
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm just using that analogy that I feel like there are all these different epistemological theories, which if you just look at them as investigations, queries and frameworks to understand, categorize, dissect knowledge.

390
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I see different demos, those lenses that I had mentioned, right? Lenses of looking at reality are what each of these frameworks are.

391
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So what happens? Instagram filters.

392
00:48:46,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Now here is the key part. Each of them start telling you that there is a certain moksha, nirvana, whatever, orgasm, whichever stage, like there is a certain stage that you can reach if you follow these certain processes.

393
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Now, if you break down those processes, study deeper, you'll see that they are very logical, very one after the other, very well structured journey, meaning that it is possible to reach that moksha.

394
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And it's like a definition of done, that there is a clear definition in each of these traditions.

395
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What do they mean by their equivalent enlightenment is the word that I was looking for.

396
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
What is the equivalent enlightenment in their traditions? What does that mean?

397
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And as it happens, it is a lot of analytical data processing, sensory data processing, building up maxims, building up more and more compressed knowledge, which some of them also talk of the neoteny that you mentioned.

398
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:00,000
How do you get a crystallized knowledge but to retain the neoteny? That is a sort of moksha state or pre-moksha state for most of these systems.

399
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But then my question, the my what if scenario is, what if we could codify these, do the computations and just try to reduce the time it takes to arrive at that moksha in maybe a scoped way.

400
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So specific intelligence as opposed to general intelligence.

401
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But it is possible to arrive at moksha, which is now if I just basically try to pass a data set through the kind of filters, they have talked of practices, they have talked of practices or loops, filters are well, like stages are filters.

402
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You have to pass certain rituals to get somewhere or go through certain commandments.

403
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's a very well articulated system.

404
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So if you can think of a flow, you would be able to map out each of these into very complex flows.

405
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And if you then think of it from that flow based programming or functional programming concept, you should be able to build higher order functions, which basically form these.

406
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And my hypothesis there is with or without AI, it should be possible to build the structural manifolds, which provides a sort of variability into existing data.

407
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And then one of those views is like just a model that understands the AI way of looking at knowledge, which means it can categorize based on everything you throw at the knowledge base that these were the testimonies that you had heard.

408
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
These were the hypothesis that you had conjectured.

409
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
These were the inferences that you had built.

410
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
These were the experimental perceptions that you have had and thus this is the knowledge that you have gotten.

411
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And these are, you can trace these back to these proofs with this much certainty.

412
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The probability of knowledge happening is baked into these systems.

413
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So not everything is certain.

414
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You can be, you can get conflicting inputs.

415
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So basically that is basically that some might be saying but it is probably a lower confidence score compared to you have touched it and you have felt it to be a sensory perception.

416
00:52:32,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Again, sensory perception migrations and so basically I see huge value in taking this at least some epistemological thinking, which is again the past to address the challenges of the present, which is building them up into systems that can process data and produce meaningful outputs to actually build some sort of an emulator or plan for the future.

417
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:14,000
A sufficiently well-planned, sufficiently well-structured plan can be called an emulator because you can probably run it and play with it to emulate the conditions that might just happen.

418
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So I'm basically starting from that hypothesis that what would it need to then build a system like that and turns out just that question has a lot of cross-cutting implications across the systems.

419
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
What is the difference?

420
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What I'm hearing, what I'm hearing, not to cut you off, let's get you to do that.

421
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Go on, finish it.

422
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I mean, I'm just saying that maybe what you will be able to do is sum up that better.

423
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yes, so you're talking about the application aspect of this, which is the gradual next step anyway.

424
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Once you have built up something that is solid, once you build up a tool that works, the next step is definitely application aspect of it, right?

425
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,000
The challenge there is I am very bad at that part or realizing when it's a good enough tool to be useful.

426
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I am not interested in the application.

427
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So to say when we say application, there is a certain application of philosophy.

428
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
When you are going into a debate, that is an application of philosophy, that is applied philosophy.

429
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
When you're writing a treatise, that is applied philosophy.

430
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm saying there is a scope to build certain fundamental building blocks of software which exhibit these systems.

431
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So just to map them out in just in the form of a framework.

432
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Right, that part, got it.

433
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah, so when I say application, I'm talking of that.

434
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm talking of it's like converting what somebody said as a proof to a series of mathematical equations if there is a logical flow.

435
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So then what would be those components?

436
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What would be like the building blocks of such a system?

437
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And that keeps on taking me to a graph like nodes, components, actions, workflows kind of system.

438
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And by now, so these were kind of niche, I would say in 2014, like flow based programming was like limited to airplane software design and all.

439
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But now with the no code, low code thing, you see that everybody is implementing flows and kind of bringing back that part of things.

440
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Which makes me think that we don't even need to build the application layer.

441
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:56,000
In the truest sense, we could be building that common API, that common library or the fundamental building blocks, which then, well, render using Unreal Engine, render using something like your user interfaces could be anything.

442
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Build a game for all I care in which the learner is tested on Nya Epistemology.

443
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Right.

444
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:30,000
The challenge that I am seeing here, the reason it seems like GPT-4 or maybe even GPT-5 or something like that would not readily be able to do this is because there's a fundamental issue of what their initial starting condition was.

445
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And their initial starting condition was not to look at the world epistemically, the data that it has, but more.

446
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I might be able, I might misinterpret this or say it wrong, but continue a conversation, essentially.

447
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That's basically what it is trying to do by looking at all the data that has happened before.

448
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Where the discussion goes.

449
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Not really, it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong or based on which framework can you decide or even approach it to be right or wrong.

450
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And again, that Rajyuta Sharpa Brahm part, so I do see it.

451
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:22,000
What Google Bard has done is that it comes up with three different answers and lets you choose which one, which way of approaching it would you prefer.

452
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Something similar can be done with various degrees of tunability where you can, for a model that actually is going that direction, where it actually has the understanding and interpretation.

453
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,000
If you want consequentialism as your preferred mechanism, then you go and interpret this this way.

454
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But if you are more of a deontologist, you go that way.

455
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And those two can both be the answers that you're looking for, depending on what your preferences are.

456
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But it understands that, right?

457
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:05,000
There are some, so the models do, nowadays the models do understand those concepts a little bit, as in it will continue the discussion.

458
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Claude does better than Chad GPT.

459
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So Claude is probably the best one on that particular aspect.

460
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But fundamentally, they are not built to, like for epistemic, they were built for just continuing conversation or discussion.

461
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
So that's where I see the challenge.

462
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But it's not so much of a challenge.

463
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's just we have to wait a little while, maybe by the end of this year or early next year, by which time the entire, like the, we'll understand it enough.

464
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:50,000
But hey, now that we have done this, we have built the application layer of how to use these things or how to retrain them, how to how to fine tune them.

465
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
How to change the initial condition and what is required to do that.

466
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Those parts will be better understood.

467
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Once that is done, then we actually can build up a model that does exactly this.

468
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
In fact, that can become one of the co-hosts of this show.

469
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And like basically fact check us or correct us or basically point our blind spots, saying that you forgot to do that.

470
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Like you brought up the Naya Shastra into this, right?

471
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That was helpful. That was yet another triangulation point.

472
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It can do that much more readily.

473
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Real time context that comes up, like whatever we're talking about, it comes, these are the things that already has discussed about these things.

474
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And this is how you can connect it or there's a decoherence.

475
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
All those things can be approached that way.

476
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm actually looking forward to that time that day, but I am not really sure exactly the process of how we can approach it right now.

477
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It would take quite a lot of work to actually get that to reality.

478
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah, and I have been kind of hovering around this topic for a long while to the point that just what those fundamental data structures would be of such a system.

479
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Because it looks like you can't leave everything to the AI.

480
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You can't leave everything to the human.

481
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And that is what these frameworks come in because they are a very well programmable set.

482
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And just like being able to write that fundamental data structure in the way or not data structure, like the let's say the solution in a way that you have these nodes, you have

483
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
like you basically actions, functions, whichever way you put it there.

484
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I have tried three, four different ways.

485
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And in each of them, where the AI plugs in is as a very specific purpose, well trained computation on very narrow band aspects of things.

486
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But again, this is connected to like my goal with this is, remember what I said that I want libraries to form as I continue living my life.

487
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's basically tying to that, right?

488
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That retrievability is a very strong aspect of each of these.

489
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So to continue to continue from that aspect, I am seeing a lot of positive movements on in that direction where the nebulas.

490
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You remember I complained about that.

491
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Hey, we have come to a point where I can write a node module and somebody somewhere in Serbia or Indonesia, people can just pull it and use it to the API that I have defined.

492
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And it will be the entire ecosystem is very well formed.

493
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But if I write a paper about something, you cannot readily utilize it in your math readily.

494
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It still will have to be somebody who has to go through all those different people who are reviewing that.

495
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Proving something had been nebulas and very much human dependent for a long part, a long time.

496
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Now, some progress are being made to challenge that.

497
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
In fact, mathematicians are kind of getting frustrated about it.

498
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
What's what's the need for us in that case anymore?

499
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So this is one of the I don't know whether this is going to be the winner in that sense.

500
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But this approaches that and solves that problem.

501
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:43,000
How do you pitch a proof proof of something that connects from human to machine bidirectional rate?

502
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So now systems as well as systems can prove things and present it to humans.

503
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Humans can verify add or and or add addendum to that.

504
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But all those things are possible.

505
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
This is huge in a sense.

506
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,000
If we have a deterministic system for proving knowledge.

507
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And we can set the data point about, hey, these are the data points.

508
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Now, those two things combined actually helps us get to the point that we're talking about, where there's a model that can do that.

509
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Be assistive enough or basically just complete enough information, complete enough in that regard that we can go and ask some about something or introduce a new data point.

510
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And it will have enough context to know which bucket to put it in, how to create the embeddings, where the vector location it falls on.

511
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So I'm seeing a lot of potential there.

512
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I wanted to discuss this, but like bring this one out since I discovered it, but didn't come out as an idea.

513
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I couldn't remember it when I needed to.

514
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
This time I remembered it.

515
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Look into that.

516
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
You might like it.

517
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You're talking of the lean provers that you share.

518
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

519
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:19,000
The ecosystem around it or the same way what chat GPT made frustrated the school teachers, in a sense.

520
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Similarly, this lean prover is making mathematicians frustrated in that particular narrow domain, fringe domain.

521
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I just want you to just go through that and have that in your context.

522
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:42,000
When we're talking about these topics that hey, tools like this are either they already exist, or they would become relevant in upcoming time.

523
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Think about Rust back in 2013.

524
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Right, something like that.

525
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
This is the lean prover is like Rust back in 2013.

526
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I just realized I had unmuted and then I went to speak.

527
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I muted myself.

528
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:08,000
As it happens, I have tried implementing the basics in so many different languages.

529
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I have a go version.

530
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I have JS, vanilla JS.

531
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I have sales JS.

532
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I haven't tried Python because well.

533
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But Rust is where these concepts just fit.

534
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Even Haskell.

535
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I have tried both Haskell and OCaml and it was like, okay, nice.

536
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
If I was a mathematician, I would have approved.

537
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But with Rust implementing some of these, it feels like the language was built to handle these sort of complex low level systems.

538
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And which makes like what the point I wanted to make is like Rust is the natural choice to implement any such things that we are discussing.

539
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And then make use of the API, make use of Wasm.

540
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
You are opening up doors to pretty much every other reason for that.

541
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Why did that end up happening?

542
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I do feel like it's one of those critical inflection points, right?

543
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
That at a point when we are saying historically about the Rust project, I don't know.

544
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I'm talking about why Rust ended up becoming this.

545
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,000
If you remember, it went through two sets of transformation, like massive transformations.

546
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But where it landed, it seems very appropriate for this.

547
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I mean, why?

548
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The borrow checker frustrated people, of course.

549
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:49,000
But then the type system, the uncompromising focus on maintaining that type system, because it is the type system which makes it ergonomic to implement a lot of these.

550
01:06:49,000 --> 01:07:02,000
The second was Rust deciding not to be just an unsociable nerd, but actually become sociable, get into that geek category.

551
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And, you know, connect with other things.

552
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So the API, the core was built from the foundation, like at least it's part of that, where it is possible to connect, look into Rust from other systems.

553
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So connectivity from other, open to connections.

554
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And then the incremental build that you were saying that it built upon the mistakes of the past while looking into the future.

555
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:36,000
But it learned the good things from the past, implemented for the present while looking at what future software can do.

556
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I think I'll have to rephrase the thing that I was going to say with your information, because that makes a lot of sense.

557
01:07:47,000 --> 01:08:04,000
What I was going to say is that it had the starting condition, the initial condition, what it tried to do, a kind of made sure that if it is successful to do that, it will end up in a state where it is ending up.

558
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:18,000
However, I realized there are other, let's say other languages, they tried to be purist in that sense, had very strong sense of like where it needs to go, etc.

559
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
But then they didn't get exactly the same way where Rust went.

560
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And the part is, what you mentioned, being the sociable thing, like taking the feedback, be willing to change yourself well enough with time and with the requirement of people, even though it's not fun for you and it gets you down from your high horse.

561
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It's worth enough to go through the transformation, go through the Laravel and PewPaw stages to get to that.

562
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Otherwise, you get stuck in a self-loving, like echo chambers, like Haskell and many other languages like that.

563
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:18,000
They live that life. They're pure in a certain sense. And because they love their purism, that purism so damn much, they don't want to end up becoming what is popular by sacrificing some of the part that other people do not like about.

564
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Where Rust actually did, like, OK, you don't like it that, like, it's not convenient enough. OK, let's make it easier for wider people, which helped.

565
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Sometimes they even went back. Some concepts actually went back after making it way too like mushy mushy and then it's not landing well enough.

566
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So that being willing to change with time and for wider spread basically is the fundamental aspect of what makes a species survive, basically survivalist approach to things.

567
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:07,000
That's what, along with the starting condition, because that is required. Without that, you again, you will lose your way. You need that.

568
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:16,000
But not being afraid to change with time, as long as you have your not star fixed. Those two things together is what got it there.

569
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I'm pretty happy that one of the languages did, because usually what ends up happening, things that I put my bets on or things that I like, quote unquote, end up failing massively because of that extensive purist standpoint.

570
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I'm really rather happy. I also came down from that extensive purist standpoint for myself and also saw that all the different projects or aspects of life that came down from that.

571
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That transformation, that metamorphosis is what gives them the extra extended life that carries them to the next section, next phase.

572
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:08,000
No, no, no, Edmund, it's going in the same direction. Carry on, carry on.

573
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I don't know whether to bring out yet another topic, but I have a couple of those things that I have been looking into.

574
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So first of all, not first of all, in this particular topic that we are going into for that topic, sublist, for this sublist, first of all.

575
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So I had a plan about because it fit. I have a plan about approaching three different topics and having three different names for the books called white matter, gray matter and dark matter.

576
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So the white matter is basically the philosophy.

577
01:11:48,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Gray matter is about the human condition, the psychological aspect of things, and the dark matter is about on physics, like the cosmology, et cetera, et cetera.

578
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
All those three things, concepts basically connect together. But that was the approach.

579
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm not so sure because they're kind of like boiling down to the same thing, same part.

580
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:31,000
It's a little bit weird, but it seems like when you're trying to decide on the discuss on that white matter, the gray matter affects that your perception, your human condition affects the epistemic that you see and the interpretation of the reality also gets affected by that.

581
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,000
One aspect of that was the philosophy of metamorphosis.

582
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Looking at the systems that are impure and impure the exact right way that it becomes advantageous to be impure in that matter.

583
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Think about Voldemort as one example.

584
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Think about the silicon as in doped semiconductors as one example, where the right amount of doping is what gives them the superpower.

585
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Other than that, they are not super in any sense.

586
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:39,000
What is it about things that when we assign value to something, we kind of do that in a Boolean sense, we say something is good, something is bad.

587
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That has been that entire moral and ethical schools of all different ways to think about it.

588
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Aristotle did pose a kind of a middle ground, OK, too much, too little and just right.

589
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I want to kind of expand on that just right part from the from the perspective of it does not live in a vacuum that just right.

590
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Are you familiar with the concept that I'm talking about?

591
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So just to just to for anybody listening to this.

592
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So before Aristotle, like Plato and what's his name, Socrates, their philosophy was there's good, virtue and vice.

593
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And they're kind of Boolean in a sense, good and bad.

594
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Aristotle was like, no, here's the thing.

595
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Too much of anything is bad.

596
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:46,000
If you are a person that is way too serious, that is not going to be registered as a good thing and would be beneficial for you.

597
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
If you're too much of a callous person, that also is not going to get registered as a good thing.

598
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:59,000
If you can bridge those two things together to come to a middle ground where you are serious enough but cheerful enough,

599
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that is going to be give you the charm that people are looking for that is going to work in your favor.

600
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So that's the that's the ground he was working with.

601
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:20,000
He kind of created nine of those sections and all those things, all different things that I don't think that set of like those nine items were comprehensive enough or anything.

602
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But it establishes the point that you can see that in a spectrum.

603
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:37,000
My perspective is that you can still do that in a vacuum for any of the virtues, advices by themselves.

604
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You have to look at it in which playground you are playing.

605
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Carry on, carry on. You can get into this.

606
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So the point I was trying to make is that you have to look at it in terms of where is this tool being applied.

607
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And that's where that particular customization, which any of those attributes, any of the traits can be termed as good or bad.

608
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:24,000
But depending on the use cases, the utilitarian perspective, some of those things can be identified as advantages.

609
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That's exactly what mutation is all about.

610
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:37,000
How mutation kind of promotes evolution and survival of the species.

611
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That is the thing, the stochastic changes in some certain things that ends up.

612
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So that's how evolution basically promotes, OK, go through multiple generations of things and whatever is supposed to stick around will stick around by just trial and error.

613
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
That's a very brute force way of doing something.

614
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That is, evolution does not have a brain of its own.

615
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But the way it ensures survival purely to its teleological own end, can you survive well enough to create another version of you with the good traits that you have and just loop that?

616
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So how am I going to now come coming back to the talk about the entire part about the philosophy of halflings?

617
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And then I'll go to the metamorphosis part, the halfling, the impurity.

618
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So various different aspects of life in various different aspects of life, there are traits that people can use that gives them an advantage.

619
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Or not only people like it transcends that.

620
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But whenever you're trying to think of any of those traits in a vacuum, you can come to a like it's good or it's bad.

621
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But the moment it gets infused with other things, other aspects of that, it becomes completely different.

622
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
It becomes either a necessity or a disadvantage in a sense.

623
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Like a squirrel, you might not think why having a wing would be advantageous.

624
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:46,000
But if a squirrel gets the mutation of flappy like that handling the passive to support a passive flight from jump from tree to tree, how does that gives it evolutionary benefit to sustain its legacy?

625
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
That is stochastic.

626
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It's a weird addition.

627
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And those kind of weird additions are always there.

628
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Usually we're not mindful about those things.

629
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
This does not live.

630
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
This entire concept does not live.

631
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
In a pure.

632
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Interpretation of first virtual advice.

633
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
How do we frame that?

634
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Because this becomes very utilitarian.

635
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And that also might be a problem for some as in people who see things as a deontological perspective.

636
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
From that, they need to know whether something is good or bad.

637
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:42,000
How do we reconcile that aspect of things like sometimes there is no good or bad or there absolutely is we're just not looking at it right.

638
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
How do you think about this?

639
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:54,000
By the way, are you utilitarian or are you deontologist?

640
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I believe in complexity.

641
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And whoever gives me the complexity because I'm their slave.

642
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Why I said that was that my gripe with most of these things is not about the.

643
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It's not about if anything is good or bad or how people understand my gripe is the sort of reductionist approach of morality to constantly try to bring things down to.

644
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Now, very polarized, very small set of values.

645
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And what happens when multiple things interact, which is what you were saying.

646
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I mean, I'm just adding to yours, not getting that.

647
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The issue is that when some form of event interaction, some form of complexity comes up, that is when.

648
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,000
The smaller free thought framework, smaller, smaller moral frameworks break down.

649
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Even if you progressed as much as saying that a good and bad are not two values, it's a spectrum.

650
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:14,000
You are still susceptible to the same thing because you are still susceptible to that one dimensional mapping of everything that is going on.

651
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And. If anything, that generative is showing us is that to achieve higher and higher truth, better and better understanding and better and better predictions, we need to embrace more complexity.

652
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We need to think in more dimensions, compute that many instances.

653
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Now, what I'm trying to say is that this there is a certain.

654
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,000
There is a certain way of even building systems.

655
01:21:47,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And I don't just mean software systems, a reductionist way of building systems, which in like, which wants to bring things down to this concepts of pure, impure, good, bad, impure being card, like the not pure existence of the not pure.

656
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
As often happens in that sense, the not pure happened to be the minority.

657
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:19,000
The pure happened to be the majority or the historical origins in which the pure happened to be the older, the non pure happened to be the newer.

658
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So this line of inquiry, the slippery slope is it often leads to the kinds of bias where the system, the legality of the system is justified.

659
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But the effect it has outside that system outside the purview of that system is often disastrous and disastrous to the point of no recovery.

660
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Like there is a certain point of no return because you have simplified things so much you cannot trace back to what complex origins they were.

661
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And that is when superstitions emerge or let's say xenophobia emerges and a bunch of these things can be traced back.

662
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:08,000
But then there is a certain value in retaining the complexity to a certain level.

663
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So you are map reducing definitely because you want certain things to be computed.

664
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:26,000
But then the question is, what are those points of intervention in which the actor in this moralistic computation needs to step in and make certain micro judgments?

665
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
As opposed to be given a good or bad result. You can get a good or bad result if you want to.

666
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And some of these concepts also underpin the reformation of justice systems that we see today around us.

667
01:23:43,000 --> 01:24:04,000
The entire conversations around death penalties or around like mass incarceration that reform community work as a better option to mass incarceration, which like saves the state money and so on.

668
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
But if you look at the other perspective that what you are saying is that it's not pure and impure elements of the society.

669
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I know I'm going towards society a bit, but just to draw that analogy that why diversity?

670
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Why be inclusive? And again, connecting back to what did Rust do, which is where we kind of went into this from.

671
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Is Rust embraced this resisting the reductionism, so to say, that it said that, OK, you cannot just say that these are this is the way to build software.

672
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Everything else is irrelevant. What it did was set certain core guarantees.

673
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:53,000
One of them, one of those principles happened to be zero cost abstractions, which said that if I remove the runtime, if I reduce the runtime to near zero,

674
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:05,000
or if you're using just the same crust, you don't have a runtime, in which case you should be able to write your code in any form that you choose.

675
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You want classes, you want excessive abstraction.

676
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:16,000
You can do that, but they are zero cost because end of the day, they are getting compiled to the similar underlying machine code.

677
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Now, what that gives, if you look at it, it's very federal in nature.

678
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's saying that the core constitution remains the same.

679
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,000
You should try to stay as close to the constitution, but certain traditions are different for you.

680
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
You don't eat this. You don't drink that. You don't want this. You want these notable.

681
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:48,000
That's fine. You should still be able to run the same federal system without trying to impose on each other or take over the system.

682
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:59,000
So this is the sort of ingrained decentralized federal nature of also looking at community, of also looking at the systems.

683
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
The same thoughts build the systems, the same thoughts like the community first approach.

684
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It's kind of like I described this to somebody a few weeks back that rust is basically at some point introverts, introverts in which ever sense, like socially awkward people eventually deciding that they'll do better work if they just for once work with each other.

685
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
They don't have to like each other. They don't have to party with each other.

686
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:32,000
They have to build RFs together. They have to vocally critique the work. They have to review the pull requests. They have to draw the roadmaps.

687
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Wait, it's kind of like a wizard's convention.

688
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So in that sense, rust is like United Nations done right.

689
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:48,000
It has a functioning product. It is not a body crippled by similar, very similar motives.

690
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:56,000
If you compare what is it that United Nations does not want to do, which is what makes its progress slow.

691
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:09,000
And as it turns out, if you were to make some drastic changes in United Nations to ensure certain actions towards climate change, they start looking like some of the things that the rust community has done.

692
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Some point you have to draw a boundary and say no.

693
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:21,000
But at some points you also have to be accommodating, convince the existing people in the group that you have to let these people in.

694
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:26,000
You cannot be a roadblock. You cannot block their coming into the community.

695
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But to those new people coming in, also sensitize them that look, this is the existing set of people.

696
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Once you are in, you have to play by these rules and these are non-negotiable.

697
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So, yeah, I mean, I was just trying to tie this together.

698
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I see the point in like the connection between the two.

699
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yes. Yeah. So the morality part, what I feel is the question should not be one that of purity and impurity.

700
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
The question of purity only comes in the case of the conductivity.

701
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:20,000
If the purpose is verified that do we need a homogeneous society?

702
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Do we need a homogeneous classroom?

703
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Do we need a homogeneous colony, country or a homogeneous even software system?

704
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,000
In whichever way you think of it, it seems like if it is more result oriented, if it is more outcome oriented,

705
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
then the first thing to identify is the purpose valid.

706
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:53,000
So, for example, you say that we need only like certain type of people in the army for the army to function at its peak,

707
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
which then goes into gender segregation, racial segregation, caste segregation,

708
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
because upper caste people won't take orders from lower caste people.

709
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So you have to break down caste, it seems, before you can have a functional army.

710
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And then army is like, you know what, let's just hire upper class men or upper caste men.

711
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
That is one way to solve the problem.

712
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
The entire thing will operate very smoothly.

713
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:24,000
But unless you establish the purpose then and what I'm trying to do is bring in the complexity and saying that do not anchor on the end result.

714
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Do not just evaluate the end result.

715
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Evaluate the purpose, evaluate the process and compute the end result and have the heart, have the courage to accept that end result.

716
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:50,000
If you have put, if your process is well established, if your purpose is well reviewed and you are executing in a certain way,

717
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:58,000
be okay with the results because it's likely that you have not seen certain variables which might be impediments during your design.

718
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:08,000
This is called the agile way in software development, as it turns out, that be open to reacting to things, optimize process for people,

719
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
build processes for people, not the other way around.

720
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And the reason humanity keeps on circling back on some of these core tenets is that it seems like if you ignore complexity,

721
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:30,000
you are doing the same kind of idiotic gesture that a hunter gatherer human just tries to be careful of the tiger

722
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,000
at the peril of ignoring the forest fire, which is I want to give tigers away.

723
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I want to put fires all around me.

724
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Tigers are bad.

725
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
So basically you don't want to go down that reductionism.

726
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Now why, where this is the slippery slope is minds like your and mine can constantly self-check and stay on a certain blade's edge.

727
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Even when conducting something which is just with two values or which is with homogeneous, there is that sense of alertness.

728
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
On an average, humans don't have that alertness, that self-correction is missing.

729
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And which is why you see religious dogmatism pervade to the point because those are simpler frameworks to look at the world.

730
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
These people are not stupid.

731
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:22,000
They're not stupid in the sense that they are not capable of computation.

732
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,000
But you just can't compare a Pentium II processor, put it with a core i9, give them the same task.

733
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I mean, not the right example.

734
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Not the right example.

735
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
In a sense, I was trying to correct the analogies.

736
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It's not about hardware, hardware.

737
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Not about the hardware.

738
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
The software that is running is not does not understand.

739
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Yeah.

740
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah.

741
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I mean, in that sense, it's more like Windows kind of different.

742
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
It's a Linux version.

743
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
The exact same core i9.

744
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
If you apply the right software, it can work differently.

745
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,000
And what is the difference that Windows is trying to take a lot more decision for you?

746
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Yeah.

747
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
What does religion?

748
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
What is the solace of religion?

749
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Practicing religion.

750
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
It is computing.

751
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So it is giving you a small set of model codes.

752
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Precomputed.

753
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Believe in it.

754
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Delegating.

755
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Limited customizability.

756
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yeah.

757
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So what is religion doing for you?

758
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I was trying to answer that question.

759
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Would that be delegating responsibility in a sense?

760
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
It is.

761
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Instead of trying to figure it out.

762
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I'll do it myself.

763
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And no, this is so that kind of goes into a discussion about.

764
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Isn't there a saying about like know what you can control, know what you cannot control and know the differences, something like that.

765
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
It sounds something like that.

766
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I'm pretty sure I'm messing it up in a sense.

767
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So what it says that there are things that you cannot control.

768
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Don't be too worried about it because there is also again overdoing that part and going into substance abuse and all the other kind of things where it kind of helps to assign that to a destiny or a God or something like that.

769
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That's the part I cannot control.

770
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Let let that be it.

771
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Whatever that is.

772
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Let's focus on the part that I can control and hope that my life turns out as something that I am OK with or happy with.

773
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Or I can give myself the illusion of that's the best life that I can have.

774
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That pretty much where it boils down to the entire concept of worship.

775
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Why would you want to worship something or go back to like.

776
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Basically sign your free will away in a sense to some extent.

777
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
If something happens because your destiny wanted it to be.

778
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,000
That means it's not that you that changed the destiny but destiny wanted your path to go that way.

779
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,000
So that is kind of signing off signing away your free will in a sense.

780
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Why would you.

781
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Again it doesn't matter where I stand on the free will part like the.

782
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Keeping that aside I'm talking about in general sense.

783
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So that's where the concept of this entire.

784
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So that results into a broken self regulation.

785
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
If you are expecting somebody is doing the regulation.

786
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
That means you are not responsible or liable for the regulation.

787
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And what happens when we don't use a particular muscle.

788
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It atrophies right.

789
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:52,000
So that's the same thing when you are talking about the part about being able to work or like walk on the knife's edge.

790
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And not being able to why that happens why people don't.

791
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Like most in general don't want to or can't or fail to walk like walk on the knife's edge because they lose that muscle.

792
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:17,000
They lose that self regulation because they attribute the delegate that self regulation regulation part itself on somebody else.

793
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And I'm not talking about only on religion.

794
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:30,000
It does come down to the regulation of the justice justice system etc.

795
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It also does come down to that is the comes down to the governments as well.

796
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:44,000
All the system where you need to look up to somebody like a big brother or a father figure in order to get something done anywhere that is.

797
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
That means you are weakening yourself.

798
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:01,000
You are not just a small political commentary at this point is this is the part I feel like resonates the most with Ambedkar warning people about hero worship in Indian politics.

799
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And he was kind of talking from this delegation perspective as well that we are prone to doing that because it is easier because it is convenient.

800
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But yeah end of commentary the curious part though in all of this is that you can in fact live your life in binaries but just wanted to tie this up to one of the maxims of life for me.

801
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I think I briefly touched it on last days be wary of binaries and I mean be excessively skeptical of monogamists.

802
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And in either sense the reason for that wariness is that it's OK to walk on that knife's edge.

803
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And again each of these systems that we are talking of what are they trying to do the role they play in a human's life.

804
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:16,000
They are sort of a competitor to religious beliefs you will find at every step whether they mock or ridicule or this they claim to be delivering an alternate lifestyle to what everyday religious practice is granting.

805
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And that is in sort of the complexity of things but how it grants is it says that you would eventually go back to doing the same kind of things.

806
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:37,000
You would eventually understand what is good or bad what is the self what is the other you would end up with this knowledge of binary but by then you would have learned how to compute the binary.

807
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And walking on that knife's edge is then that balancing act that you are doing constantly evaluating checking yourself that are you at any point transgressing these boundaries which should then call to question your final decision.

808
01:37:52,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Which means it's saying that with enough practice in a certain form humans can be better model like more moralistic creatures be able to compute good and bad quicker because it also can warns you about the non-computational complexity owning problem that you suddenly expose yourself to a lot of complexity and you hit that numbness the indecision.

809
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:35,000
So for these traditions the goal is not to stay in that indecision but to be decision makers very fast decision makers very intuitive decision makers very decision making is backed by these things.

810
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So you're not offloading that computation unless you're offloading that computation to certain systems which form under this and that is where their proof of knowledge their way to motion all come in basically they're saying that you can if you want to be the dharmic some say that some say that you be the ideal citizen.

811
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Most of these are chasing ideals in some way or the other and that ideal is that blue line you know that that is where you want to be they're first pointing that out so they begin with a hypothesis.

812
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
No that's not a hypothesis that's the set point that is.

813
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I'm saying they begin with the hypothesis that we want to be there let's first prove our intention it's at the starting point it's like saying first you do you think you want to go first figure that out before you start on your journey you don't want to be lost so you start on your journey look up the map do your research then start walking.

814
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:52,000
So then you start approaching that curve so basically in this foundational work a lot happens in that part before takeoff.

815
01:39:52,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And that is the initial state basically the valid verification and validity of that initial state is just as important for them to then say that you will go the right way so they're basically putting that computation there charting your path then letting you go.

816
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It's like if you then follow the trajectory it's like Chochandra and three right with minor remote commands you should be able to land in the right place but the computation is done before launch.

817
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:47,000
My interpretation of that is it starts the way it starts it starts holding hands of a very limited set of entities that wants to head that way over time more associations come in and gives it the momentum it needs which is why it gets closer.

818
01:40:47,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Now the only challenge is again I don't want to like harp on that particular thing for far too long the proportionality part of things it basically whenever it reaches close enough it basically loses the interest we got almost there so I'm not interested about it anymore.

819
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:22,000
In that sense a lot of people have become comfortable at the 80% like reaching 80% success and be fine with that that's when you need to find the people who are like no this is not ideal we need to pull it out and that's where the integral comes in.

820
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So again not to dwell on that but I think that's the way it's not about pre-planning the whole thing before the journey starts that's not even though I prefer it to be that way the planners self would want to be that way usually.

821
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
You are like identifying the stages like the root so to say.

822
01:41:44,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Yeah I'm saying that somebody just starts going that way gradually more people join in and figure that part out the plan on the way usually that's how pretty much everything like the all the revolution that's how it happens.

823
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:19,000
The plan is not set in stone and it's not that if you if you keep it that way and don't adapt with changes you're actually going to have much more much of a success you're actually going to fail because the reality is much more messy and chaotic than you can plan out to be like complete details right.

824
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:36,000
So the part the part of the other thing is that it's not completely planned out from beforehand somebody some entity some particular person that wants to leave a mark on the reality starts heading on one way and either they get the momentum to go that direction or they don't.

825
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:45,000
For any kind of set point approach you see there's thousands of set point approaches that we don't see because they fail right.

826
01:42:45,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So that was the other point that I was trying to make from what you are saying I was I don't know whether it goes as a correction or an addendum but that's how I'm seeing it the way it starts off the journey starts essentially.

827
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So what I meant by charting the route is basically identifying intervention points possible intervention points having certain event based thing you know like I'm saying I'm just telling you how the systems.

828
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:40,000
How I'm saying how this knowledge systems work so when they are how do they do research so basically when you go into the AI and I'm talking about okay so my way when you do that is I was saying that when you do that how the approach is broken down it's basically the question of how do you acquire knowledge.

829
01:43:40,000 --> 01:44:04,000
And you are talking about subset of people who are into this yeah I'm talking subset of people who are understanding was my thinking the mass yeah so my question and this is my lifelong question is that how can I that is what you're saying that how can I take what these people know to the masses that what would that look like that was one of those hypothetical things that I had.

830
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Good but that was the question I wanted to pose it now I just want to wrap this up this part of the discussion and I think the final thing to mention here is he.

831
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:22,000
The important part then in the human machine interface conversation.

832
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Becomes identifying like having that ability to.

833
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Becomes identifying like having that ability to synthesize from a hypothesis that is put to action by actors of certain sort like the thesis and the antithesis being put to work contrasted with the hypothesis.

834
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:03,000
But the part that I agree with you is that the obvious expansion to hegelian dialectic is the ad that the synthesis is the goal.

835
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Formation of it is not.

836
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
And you want to introduce that hypothetical state.

837
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:20,000
At which point you have a I don't know if it is more is it like but at that point you have more of a new hegel hybrid.

838
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
In the system.

839
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And what I probably harping on a bit too much not to fan.

840
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Because I know that I'm taking one example philosophy actually does not de stigmatize like that that hypothesis yeah so that is what I mean that Nia is most most eastern traditions do not stigmatize hypothesis in fact they encourage this is what I was trying to say yes.

841
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
These traditions encourage open ended skepticism.

842
01:45:50,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And they say that open ended if you do a close ended inquiry close ended inquiry being tracing back from God.

843
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Yeah, you have already gone to the farthest extreme and you are coming down.

844
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
That is where things are prone to reduction reductionist approaches.

845
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:19,000
But if you go inward out, which is what they mean by saying that no Brahma by knowing yourself.

846
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So what does it mean by to know yourself is your first knowing your surroundings and you're working out from that and these two create very interesting differences.

847
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:46,000
The inside out tradition is a farmer synthetic tradition far more inclusive they result in frameworks which want people to come in study observe be together build.

848
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
You know systems to work with them better.

849
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Whereas the other one leads down to more our majority is in danger kind of attitude.

850
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Because it has already known the extreme and everything then has to fit that narrative or it will be forced fit.

851
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:12,000
At the cost of boxing out removing the impurities to make it pure.

852
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:28,000
And this very interestingly again a lot of American queer politics uses language which is very reductionist in that sense and you end up with labels upon labels taxonomy done reversed.

853
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,000
You are constantly breaking down one segment into 10 others.

854
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
But first you must have that one segment.

855
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It's not like when you've identified there are 10 subsections within this one section you now say that okay this was a wrong categorization.

856
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
This was premature categorization.

857
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:53,000
No, it has to be a like directed acyclic graph of some sort.

858
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I think I see the pattern in this and the reason for that.

859
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Why people go that way.

860
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
So I sent you that Joichi Ito article.

861
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I have it on my reading list.

862
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I have I have certain opinions.

863
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I want to know your take on that the problem statement you might not agree with the solution.

864
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:24,000
But it's the problem statement which you might find very dear to might I don't know.

865
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
The second link I sent is somebody else's critique of that work.

866
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Do not read that till you feel like you have a good enough idea.

867
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Got it.

868
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I mean if you don't there is nothing you won't understand because it's primarily HCI.

869
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's primarily UX.

870
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Okay.

871
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:49,000
The last point that you're trying to why reductionism pops out.

872
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Why it ends up going that direction.

873
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
This is part of a bigger discussion yet again yet another topic.

874
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And I know that for a past few sessions this will keep on happening.

875
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
So basically I think it will continue.

876
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Yeah.

877
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
But the origin of religion itself you see there's a pattern to it.

878
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:19,000
It starts from the void and the highly philosophical the spiritual interpretation of energy something from nothing etc etc.

879
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It quickly goes down into fundamental forces of nature as the gods.

880
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:34,000
And then it pops out as there are one one thing that matters more than all the other ones.

881
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And after saying the general principle let's put that into perspective of Hinduism where initially you start with void.

882
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
There are three different gods that basically pops out over time.

883
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It's not even like solidified in a once and like if you go through the purans and so you will find multiple different interpretation of that.

884
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:03,000
But eventually you get that OK these are the more philosophical standpoint of a fringe.

885
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:09,000
People at the end they have nothing else to do but think more deeply.

886
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I mean specifically Vishnu Purana.

887
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:26,000
And before Vishnu Purana is where it's kind of transitioning like hey we need to convey this message to a little bit broader audience like the kings and the people in power.

888
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
So basically it's going out of the hands of scholars.

889
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Scholars were fine with the very spiritual interpretation of it like the void and so the duality etc.

890
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
But now you need to simplify this for people who run countries.

891
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
The nations essentially.

892
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So now you're trying to convey that message to the emperors.

893
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
How do you do that?

894
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Now your story will revolve around creating the gods that are emperors and or their sidelines.

895
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,000
So now Zeus from Zeus like Norse mythology all those things even Hindu mythology like Indra and all this.

896
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Now the story revolves around the fundamental forces of nature like Vayu and the sun basically the air the earth the power of war like war gods etc.

897
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:23,000
All those things basically come into the picture and that's the interpretation because that's the demography you are trying to reach out to.

898
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:30,000
And then the third level what happens is that is the mass is still out in the void.

899
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:36,000
They're basically the life is misery and there's no end to it.

900
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
You are living in that situation.

901
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Somebody comes out says that hey look all those interpretations.

902
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:51,000
You are not in a position to understand this because you have been left in the gutter in your entire life.

903
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Without the resources to actually reconcile with those concepts that they're talking about.

904
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:04,000
You don't have the tools or utility and you are in the part where you are at.

905
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
You are at a position if what position I'm not finding the right word for it.

906
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Like you are your life has come to a point where you cannot go back and pay those debts and pick up the books and learn everything and then get to their same level.

907
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
It's not possible for you.

908
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
You need a simplified interpretation of this for you.

909
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Those what do you call that thing like the Monashat Mongol and the story of the small gods story of the one God essentially like only focus on this particular guy.

910
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
And he basically he or she will basically take away all your pains.

911
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
That also goes down to all the extra bad as in the monotheism concepts as well.

912
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Is that forget about the complexity and nuances of all the whole other things the way they have tried to interpret it for you.

913
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Just this 10 commandments and this there's only one God.

914
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
That's all you need to know.

915
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Life is easy delegate that decision making and self correction and regulation which you were not equipped with to begin with.

916
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Now this your life is now much easier.

917
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Go ahead.

918
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Now all those people for all those people life is actually much easier because it takes away the pain takes away the confusion.

919
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:27,000
If you are having a misery because God intended that maybe you have done failed at one of those 10 commandments.

920
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
That's why you're having misery.

921
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Anyways and for everything else all the carrots and sticks aside there's the ultimate one carrot and a stick heaven or hell.

922
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:48,000
So basically even if you feel like you you are going through the life not being punished for bad work or not being rewarded for your good ones.

923
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
You still keep on doing it because at the end of it there's a.

924
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:03,000
So all those things basically comes down to that reduction is the one one God one dimensional belief or worshipping tendency goes comes down from.

925
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:15,000
That entire part of the how do I I if I don't want to take responsibility for all that thing understanding all that thing or regulating myself.

926
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:23,000
How do I delegate that whole thing to a one particular God that I believe in and then it goes down that way.

927
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
So I'm not saying that it is only about religion.

928
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It expands in multiple different dimensions including the ones that you have mentioned.

929
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I also understand the paradox or not paradox the irony of me trying to reduce down the whole complexity and nuance of religion like the entire theological institution down to like OK.

930
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Hey there's only three sections.

931
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
That's that's pretty much it.

932
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I do understand that but sometimes you need to get a picture of a place to read as a memory and you cannot have the entire 3D model of the place that is not practical.

933
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So that's the only reason I'm doing this.

934
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
But I think I guess that's how it ends up happening.

935
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:14,000
For some people just living with that like getting the really pain relief is not sufficient.

936
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:28,000
They will keep on running around trying to find more data point more and more at the cost of pain to look at more complexity to assimilate more complexity and find out a better model.

937
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And they will take over the responsibility of regulation on themselves and some else would not want to do that.

938
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,000
They just want to have a happier and less painful life and they would want to delegate that.

939
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
OK, I'm done on that particular aspect that particular topic.

940
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:53,000
You sound that a better assimilate the complexity and find a better model.

941
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Is the fundamental principle to build upon to in order to resist reduction.

942
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:15,000
And you're right that it takes a certain amount of madness to throw yourself constantly into the face of complexity because it is painful to the point of being physically painful depending on what you are doing.

943
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
But like the more complexity you embrace.

944
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
The key is to not stay in indecision.

945
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
There will be periods of indecision.

946
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
The key is to know how to break out of indecision.

947
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And that is the assimilation aspect of things.

948
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:46,000
The only way you break out of indecision in the face of complexity is if you can assimilate the complexity into as a patch on your existing model and improve that at which point you have reduced.

949
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:58,000
So like I said, it is resisting in many sense the idea is to resist reducing but not stop doing it because MapReduce as a function is vitally important.

950
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Which again, remember what we said in first episode that what is important is to store this MapReduce values, but also the computational like some sort of a theorem, be it a theorem or be it like an version control snapshot in some way to prove.

951
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Those are the edges. If you see the node and edge aspects.

952
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:32,000
The reductions are the next set of nodes, but the process through it like if the function that it happens through it are the edges that connects them from.

953
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
You take this data point.

954
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
This is the function that you apply and you come up, come up over there.

955
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
If you apply a different function, you go somewhere else.

956
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:49,000
But knowing the intersection and interaction between them is where you cannot say that this one function is the rule them all and others don't matter.

957
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:57,000
That's one way. That's basically where the criticism I was making right now is that that's where people tend to go because that's easier.

958
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:04,000
So now from an HCI perspective as in human computer interface, the UX considerations, not just UX.

959
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,000
In fact, let's just call it interaction perspective, right?

960
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:19,000
The producer or the controller of the system goes from higher complexity to lower complexity.

961
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:29,000
The consumer of the system, the viewer, the accessor, the learner goes from lower complexity to higher complexity, traversing the same paths.

962
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Are we going into that entropy discussion again? The designer entropy comes in every single time.

963
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Entropy exists everywhere.

964
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
But what I said is no, no, I am not.

965
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I'm just arriving at it.

966
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
In fact, I have I'm just starting back parts I have taken already, but it fits.

967
01:58:48,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So basically the HCI considerations that you need to do is that your system needs to take in all the complexity, be constantly map reducing to give you the simplest set of values that can be portrayed on an interface.

968
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So when you look at it, you look at it as the world that appears.

969
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:20,000
It appears as a world and apparently benign, devoid of details till you start looking into things and there are infinite layers upon layers of details that you could go in.

970
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:34,000
And this as a interface design principle, ever since I realized this has built possibly the best possible APIs, best possible practices that I could ever dream of.

971
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Because connecting this back to API first, the idea behind API first design is not that you first build the API, then you think of what happens.

972
01:59:45,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Now, it's about you identify all the possible variations in the system that can come in, identify the interaction points, the map reducible points, understand what to do with the end result and how to map this.

973
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
How do you hide this complexity?

974
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Like it's like showing the map reduce result first, then showing the computation, then showing the input values.

975
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
What's wrong with that?

976
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
No, I'm saying not wrong with that.

977
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
This turns out to be an excellent API design strategy.

978
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Yeah, I think so because think about it also from like, I hope you don't have other things to add there immediately.

979
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I was just reflecting on that.

980
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:40,000
If we are talking about a new child, like in a sense like a new human trying to make sense of the world, how does that person start?

981
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
They have to start from a present.

982
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And whenever they're curious, they can go back and look at how it came to be that tracing back your point.

983
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
The point and I also agree is that there needs to be the trace back point.

984
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Like how do we get there?

985
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:01,000
The entire nodes and edges should be there, retained in a sense that anybody who wants to, who's curious enough, can go and check that back.

986
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Most people wouldn't want all the paths, wouldn't check all the paths or wouldn't find the energy to do that.

987
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Which is not like the point is you cannot force people to know you have to go read this particular like 5000 old year old book first.

988
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Then only you get to come to like eventually understanding like the present.

989
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
You cannot, which is how I was taught philosophy that that is the chronological view.

990
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Yeah, that it just doesn't fit.

991
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
It doesn't fit.

992
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It is.

993
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
It is.

994
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It doesn't fit even at a small scale.

995
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
At a very small scale.

996
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Because the realities are so different.

997
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Yeah.

998
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
The perspective is different.

999
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
And how do you expand on the perspective?

1000
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Take any of the quirks of our all those mega novels.

1001
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
What do you call those things?

1002
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
The Ramayan Mahabharata or like the epics, right?

1003
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
So any take any of the quirks, right?

1004
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Why this is happening?

1005
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Why Vishwa can steal two women and get them married to his brother or whatever that is.

1006
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:24,000
The point is, it seems like from our value of the present, it seems weird.

1007
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Now, if you ask the question, then you get the answer like further down the line.

1008
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Given that socio-economic situation, these are the things that were considered heroic or good enough.

1009
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Like it's not considered.

1010
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And then your understanding expands.

1011
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:48,000
But what if you are forced to understand from that word first, as in from back to now,

1012
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
your understanding of current would be super messed up.

1013
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Because at the highest level, you have a limited set of memory.

1014
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Memory is still as in memory in the sense of the compute element.

1015
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I'm not talking about the raw memory.

1016
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I'm talking about the amount of new neurons that you are working with.

1017
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
That's limited.

1018
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Now, you can have somewhat functional model of the world view, the womb belt,

1019
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
and then keep enriching it with more details as you find something interesting.

1020
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:26,000
But if you start from the beginning, you already have a weird sense that weird model that doesn't fit now.

1021
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:32,000
And then you're trying to retrofit it to a current model, which is screwed up.

1022
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I've seen this so many times and it frustrates me all the time.

1023
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:41,000
And the challenge is to have this conversation with any of the systems,

1024
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I have to come from so far back and have the ground level discussion of so many things

1025
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
that it doesn't make sense to have that discussion at all.

1026
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
It's just like, okay, table flip, I'm out.

1027
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Basically, that's what ends up happening.

1028
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
The table flip does not happen.

1029
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
It happens inside my head.

1030
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Yeah, it just doesn't happen because it's that much more difficult to recreate the table in its current position.

1031
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Imagine if you could just reset.

1032
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:20,000
But I just realized, I keep on saying that game design has a lot to teach the rest of application designers in software design.

1033
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
And if you look at it, the good games embrace this philosophy that I just said,

1034
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:31,000
that the designers design from a higher complexity to lower complexity.

1035
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,000
The player starts from lower complexity towards higher complexity.

1036
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,000
The games that do this the best to don't have a help panel.

1037
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:48,000
The gameplay itself teaches you how to play.

1038
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
The one immediate, two immediate, three immediate.

1039
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Okay, I can give multiple examples.

1040
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Portal, the starting of Portal or Half-Life.

1041
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Well, not Half-Life in general because Half-Life kind of started off from a certain...

1042
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
All the Valve games.

1043
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
All the Valve games.

1044
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
So basically everything built on the Valve platform.

1045
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:16,000
But Portal specifically, Portal 1 specifically in the way it teaches somebody absolutely not used to computer games,

1046
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
not used to these controls to move.

1047
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:24,000
And part of the story, and this is where the design from higher complexity to lower complexity,

1048
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:29,000
part of the story is in the beginning telling you, it's okay, you're not able to get the controls right.

1049
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
You remember that you're disoriented.

1050
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
You just woke up from this cryo sleep.

1051
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:42,000
And the validation it gives to the learner, I am not supposed to get it right immediately.

1052
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:50,000
These things, unless the designers thought of the complexity that somebody might not even know the controls.

1053
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Have you played Stanley's Parable?

1054
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
No.

1055
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Oh my God, you're missing out.

1056
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Go play that immediately after this.

1057
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Right.

1058
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Or maybe first read up on that.

1059
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
That would give you a better mental.

1060
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Otherwise, it's going to feel a little bit frustrating at first.

1061
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
But read up a little bit and then start with it.

1062
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
You are touching on that point.

1063
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I just want to have that levels, the organic level of like, where does it land?

1064
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:30,000
How Valve developers work and how much self aware their games are.

1065
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Stanley's Parable is an ode to that.

1066
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Like the game is made to be a self aware game.

1067
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
I don't think you need to read anymore.

1068
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Just just go ahead and install and play.

1069
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:50,000
So I think you're missing out if you don't play that game.

1070
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
You will.

1071
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
What you're saying is correct.

1072
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
It's right.

1073
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:59,000
You're just missing out on so much fun that I think you should enjoy this.

1074
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Yeah, I agree.

1075
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Basically, I'm trying to apply some of these into software design and ask these questions.

1076
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
One of the reason of me trying to get out of the standard corporate ecosystem was I wanted to.

1077
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Now, it's time.

1078
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Like I have spent enough time doing application building in general terms.

1079
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I'm still doing that for money.

1080
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:30,000
But the point is that I see software from this perspective that there are so many other challenges

1081
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
for which certain solutions exist.

1082
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
It's not like I was the first one to invent this.

1083
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
It's just my observation that I am presenting here.

1084
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
What that observation says is there is enough scope to bring some of these concepts,

1085
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:52,000
apply them to certain other domains of human computer interaction or machine to machine interaction.

1086
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Interaction design fundamentally escaping the confines of a screen, escaping the confines of just a small software

1087
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:09,000
being thought of as these interaction points in the world around in a broader context.

1088
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
What does that mean?

1089
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:19,000
And then what would it mean to even add with the current day technology, the immediate step, let's say,

1090
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
because I think there is a scope to build up to this.

1091
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:35,000
What is it that we can do today that in 10 years time have the last effect on making some of these ways of thinking more mainstream, more mainstream?

1092
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I am not saying I want 100 percent saturation, but I want to the level of saturation that let's say rust.

1093
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
In fact, that's the point.

1094
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Let's not set a popularity as a matrix.

1095
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I don't.

1096
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I don't.

1097
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:58,000
So I am like enough validation across a critical threshold of survival, beyond which it's propelled by community effort.

1098
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:08,000
To the point I want to see these discussions manifest themselves to a point where they become the building block for the next generation to build on.

1099
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
That's my goal.

1100
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Yep. OK.

1101
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I don't know how much time you have, but let's say that we have 15 more minutes.

1102
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I'm trying to find something, a chain of thought in five minutes.

1103
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I'll not give enough explanation.

1104
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Carry on, carry on.

1105
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:29,000
But I have time to think over the course of the week.

1106
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
This is how I'm thinking about this.

1107
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I think there's merit to bring this entire discussion, all those things as a platform, which we started with talking about.

1108
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But let's start it, the start of brink of new year.

1109
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:57,000
And until then, we can have our practice runs of jotting down or basically get our ships in order, essentially.

1110
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
So tell me, what does such a platform look like?

1111
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
It doesn't have to be too much critical.

1112
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Basically, I already have something that is going.

1113
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I can reuse the anthropic inertia is one of the platforms that strikes me as the most like non.

1114
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I mean, to what end?

1115
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I'll come, I'll come to that.

1116
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
To what end?

1117
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
What is the end result of that is?

1118
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
No, what are the end products?

1119
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
That's what I'm coming to.

1120
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I'm talking about the brand first, because then I'll come to the product, like aspects of the physics of it.

1121
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So void was more of a like it was mischievous.

1122
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
It was not welcoming enough.

1123
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:54,000
But that's why I have multiple aspects of the anthropic inertia is the one that is actually it is a reflective platform supposed to be.

1124
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Yet it is not unwelcoming.

1125
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I have posted some things there, but I don't get enough time to do more.

1126
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Anthropic inertia has a YouTube channel, which I messed up a little bit with contents that I don't want to post anymore.

1127
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
So very linear content.

1128
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
It doesn't have the longevity, essentially.

1129
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:26,000
But it also has a Spotify as in the podcast aspect of it, a sub stack and Spotify and Google Podcast and all.

1130
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
So basically it has a podcast and it has a blog post.

1131
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:38,000
What I usually do with the thoughts, like things that I've done so far is that I come with this come up with a script point that I want to make.

1132
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Then I write up about it, publish that on a sub stack.

1133
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I use my voice model to read it out loud and use that as the podcast for this podcast platforms.

1134
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
I haven't started using the videos yet.

1135
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:03,000
So if those audio we take the audio and generate video out of it and post it on YouTube, that can also be possible.

1136
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Point is that not the video point is the sub stack and the Spotify basically podcast subscriber model where people can tag along.

1137
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:21,000
They basically press a button to let you know that they are with you.

1138
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
They're listening.

1139
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:34,000
So if there's what are what to what end, that's the end where people can give you signal that they are listening.

1140
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:48,000
And then have a community of that where the discussions that we are having are having a second or third order harmonics resonant frequencies at that at multiple different levels.

1141
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Once we start establishing that, I'm again brand name.

1142
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Forget about that. I'm talking about the anthropic inertia is a perfect 20 to 23 company name or organization.

1143
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:07,000
It is a good brand exact extent, which is why I come into the realization.

1144
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
You even went with the acronyms mapping to AI.

1145
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Yeah, you see that, right?

1146
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:19,000
It's not that unobvious like I know that you would say, but yeah, so those things are basically prebaked.

1147
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I see that it has a massive potential.

1148
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Let's do it right this time.

1149
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
The right is in the sense.

1150
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Let's not be too hasty about it or look for fast gratification.

1151
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I know that it's going to take some time.

1152
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:41,000
And given my calibration, like understanding of what happened in the past, it takes about two years for things to catch up to our expectations.

1153
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:52,000
So maybe we would be we would have enough time to prepare ourselves to get to the point where enough people are listening.

1154
02:13:52,000 --> 02:14:00,000
So we need to be on topic.

1155
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Which is which is fine.

1156
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Something else struck me.

1157
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
And of course, I'm the one that jumps the gun.

1158
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Exactly five minutes.

1159
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I'm getting a lot of latency from your hands.

1160
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Sorry, you have been eight bit there for like an hour.

1161
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
OK, sorry.

1162
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
But the video is video is much better.

1163
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:23,000
You can see it on the end of 40.

1164
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I know the recording you're recording on your screen.

1165
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Yeah.

1166
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Yeah.

1167
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
So that's that's fine.

1168
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
So I watch the videos.

1169
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I've been doing that for the last two weeks.

1170
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:48,000
See, I see the entire thing that you said, the application, the applicability of converting this into carving out an application from this.

1171
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,000
If it is again, just to see scratch our own itch.

1172
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I kind of see.

1173
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
And this has been going on for a while.

1174
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:09,000
There is a sort of merger of Kong's future version, let's say, which is up speak as the knowledge management system to a lot of people have been talking.

1175
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:21,000
It probably came out the closest in your analysis just now that there is a gap for this creators platform.

1176
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Where knowledge creation or content creation has too much emphasis on quick creation, linear flow and so on.

1177
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:36,000
How can we bring in complexity capturing thought processes to broadcast to audience engagement?

1178
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I'm kind of combining up speak and X flex in my head at this point.

1179
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I am no longer seeing those things as separate units, but basically a plumbing layer that again connects these things.

1180
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And if we build outside in, which is we start with the videos, we learn the audience engagement and build from there.

1181
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,000
This will come up to with the knowledge management and these principles in place.

1182
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I see the following possible hypothetically.

1183
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:15,000
There are discussions from the discussions just like this, whether we stream or not.

1184
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I can see a complete cycle, basically a very forward looking.

1185
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
What's that called? Progressive loop.

1186
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,000
What is the loop that adds value? Positive feedback loop.

1187
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:35,000
So I'm seeing a positive feedback loop possible that start with this broadcast.

1188
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
You get incrementally better. You narrow down your topics.

1189
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:48,000
But these things being taken, the contents grouped into say a wiki, which go on to inform certain other discussions that others can participate.

1190
02:16:48,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Parallel forks of this conversation with parallel things other people doing, which can be merged, the synthesis of the idea where each contribution can be traced back to its origin story.

1191
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:10,000
That basically community as part of your subscription.

1192
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:24,000
So how do we bring you remember that was a problem statement to solve with Kong that how do you bring people who are listeners onto the platform without disturbing the flow is still a very interesting problem to solve here.

1193
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:32,000
But I am now saying instead of that just being a real time problem, I want to make it a semantic problem.

1194
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I want to make it a very well deontological problem.

1195
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Yeah, you are deontological.

1196
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:46,000
No, no, no.

1197
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I'm just saying that when I said deontological, I paused because there is an option to make it ontological, deontological, whichever direction you want to go.

1198
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Views on top of a query.

1199
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:08,000
But I'm seeing this potentially building not just a knowledge management system, but an alternative social media.

1200
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Of when I say social media, I mean socializing part of it through these narrow confines, the boundaries, which help build and maintain communities and becomes the knowledge base for future generations in certain archival formats.

1201
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:40,000
My thought, I only think that will add is that in our journey, we will find a lot of people who would be better positioned in taking care of the parts or aspects of some things.

1202
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:55,000
We need to have these things in our mind in order to be able to like, yes, we thought about this, would you like to, the delegation part has to happen because there's only a limited amount of things that you can do it right.

1203
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Think of it from the last perspective as well.

1204
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,000
The adaptation will have to happen.

1205
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:09,000
And if we are having the community support right in the right way, then the momentum would not stop.

1206
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:21,000
We just need to make sure the very minimal set of ground rules or baselines that we establish the platform that we create that is in well enough order.

1207
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Yep. So that we don't have to create keep on creating the patch rules in order to like keep the system same, which is a definitive indication of a bad system when you have lots of banded fixes.

1208
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Right. Yep. So let's focus on the core aspects of things and keep on showing the seeds. That's the one important aspect that I want to talk about is that we have shown a lot of seeds.

1209
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,000
None of those things I see as actually a failure.

1210
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I think that even if they do not come materialize the learning from them itself is a something.

1211
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:12,000
But I also do think there are options or ways to rematerialize them in a in a larger cohesive system where all those things integrate into a much bigger, much larger of a platform.

1212
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Yep. All those things actually do matter. So basically what that means is we are talking of doing the things that we do best.

1213
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Answer one potential answer to your question on session one. What is worth doing for us in our context?

1214
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:34,000
What is worth doing is be the protocol people is be the foundational principles.

1215
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:42,000
People is be the people who build the adapter system is be the people who build ways to build the RFCs.

1216
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Yes, we don't need to write the RFCs.

1217
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:57,000
No, we need to provide the basic guarantees, identify those basic guarantees that such a system has exhibited to a certain extent through some early implementations.

1218
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:02,000
The implementations would change, but to identify the boundaries of such a system.

1219
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And again, the things we understand best is how do thinkers think together, how to make thinkers think together.

1220
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
And I think that is the place to focus on how to make them.

1221
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Yeah. And I think that is the focus we should keep, which means if the output of Anthropic Inertia are these videos, a set of research papers or articles or blog posts at its simplest.

1222
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Let's say a blog post. Let's start with simpler with a set of documents that we prepare on how a potential community can form around this.

1223
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Let me narrow down the scope. Software provider that provides certain code libraries to build systems on top of them.

1224
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I do think we understand DevTools so well, we can reason about DevTools so well that we don't need to reason about application level building.

1225
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
So let that part be the topic of next discussion and I'll set it out in a sense.

1226
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Think there is a very interesting or curious case of gravity and magnetism in a certain way.

1227
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I'll explain why.

1228
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Hey, before you go, I just wanted to check. Was this a yes or no?

1229
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Yeah, I'm just saying that we don't need to jump the gun. We need to start the platform.

1230
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:40,000
But I agree that we need to be the protocol people who sets the ground rules and ponders upon whether the ground rule is set well enough or not.

1231
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,000
And interest, that's the reason I'm extending part of the discussion in the next session.

1232
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Not disagreeing, but in order to enrich that with enough point. I just don't think I should go into that discussion right now.

1233
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I'll end up exhausting myself. I'm pretty giddy, by the way.

1234
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Like if you don't, if you're not seeing, I don't know how it's coming along, but I'm like very giddy inside.

1235
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Like that it gives me like when I came out, I had lower energy state than I'm going out with.

1236
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
So anyway, so I think with that part also, we discussed before.

1237
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Point is, how do we become the magnets or the black holes where more matter feeds in?

1238
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I'm not going to I am I am not going to expand more on that today as a matter of principle for the time because yes, let's let's continue that on later.

1239
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I do. I do agree on most of like almost all the things that you said.

1240
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I just don't think we need to start with that.

1241
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Like having the expectations. I'm not certain about the order of things either.

1242
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
So because I'm just saying that that those were the instances of what we can do.

1243
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Yes, on all those records, right?

1244
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I just don't think the expectations need to be the driving principle because that's what that's what ends up being the dopamine feeders.

1245
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Essentially, you need to have a dopamine blocker in a sense that we should not live on the high right on the high.

1246
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:18,000
We should utilize that but not ride on it because anyways, longer discussion again.

1247
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Coming back to the point, I think we need to section our discussion in particular parts.

1248
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And I think one part should be for the next couple of weeks or next couple of months should be that how does the platform ends up forming?

1249
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
What are the things that are in the should be in the to do list and how do we approach this?

1250
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Because that is going to be a massive or major part by December.

1251
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:53,000
We need to have the platform ready so that we can start promoting it out and have a reveal on the New Year's kind of way.

1252
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I think that sounds very good.

1253
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:07,000
And yeah, I'm like building my handbrake and pushing the brake at the same time very, very hard.

1254
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Yes, time to slow down.

1255
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Accelerator and brake at the same time.

1256
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:18,000
No, no, I've left acceleration. I'm just braking. It's a momentum carrying me onto the next.

1257
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:25,000
But I think this is good.

1258
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Just make a note of that topic. I think that's worth doing things.

1259
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I'm not sure how much time I'll get in the week.

1260
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
But yeah, next session, we can definitely focus that focus on that.

1261
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:44,000
The only reason for me to like bring out all those topics and put it in front of you is that so that it goes into your subconscious.

1262
02:25:45,000 --> 02:26:00,000
So basically what made me pull my handbrake so hard is that is exactly where I had started my discussions with you a few weeks back with that in mind that I want to reach that stage.

1263
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
So I think like it is converging up to.

1264
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
It was always going to go that way.

1265
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Like I never had a doubt.

1266
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:11,000
It's just that we need to be meticulous about it.

1267
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:17,000
So we can't act on dopamine heat, essentially.

1268
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,000
That's my point. There's nothing wrong with dopamine heat.

1269
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
In fact, we should utilize that.

1270
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:34,000
But that should not be the driving element, because if that becomes a driving element, then chasing dopamine heat ends up becoming the actual task we end up doing and not the end result.

1271
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:40,000
So basically we need to identify where do we fit in, which you already explained.

1272
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And I agree with that part and keep on doing a better job at it.

1273
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Better job at laying down the real line and not.

1274
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I know there's more fun.

1275
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I just want to put one constraint.

1276
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I just want to put one constraint.

1277
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I think whatever we think has to be thought has to be evaluated on a larger time scale than we did earlier.

1278
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:08,000
And I mean, like, I don't know how long.

1279
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I don't know if it is like a 10, 12 years.

1280
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I don't know.

1281
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:20,000
But the longest basically the longevity of each of those things have to be evaluated and put priority over short term gratification.

1282
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Right.

1283
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,000
And for that matter, we need a set point rate that jump set point.

1284
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:32,000
So that's the part I was going to connect with the topic that I'm not going to discuss on the next next session.

1285
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Let's let's do that.

1286
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Because having a set point is very much important and having clarity on that is very much.

1287
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Yeah.

1288
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
All right. Good.

1289
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So that's pretty much it for today's session.

1290
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I'm going to go ahead and in the stream and.
