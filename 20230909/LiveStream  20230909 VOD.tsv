0	8000	I'm trying to go live.
8000	16000	Before you go, do you have any specific topic in mind?
38000	46000	I'll leave the OBS behind.
46000	62000	Assuming everything else is happening fine and the audio levels are fine, let's start with an introduction which is going to be awkward anyway.
62000	64000	Hello and welcome everyone.
64000	79000	We are continuing forward from our last session, which was the introduction, so hopefully this time we'll have a little bit nicer grip on the topic or discussion and the flow of it.
79000	85000	With that said, I have roughly 3 topics.
85000	95000	The first one is that, remember we were talking about how do we demystify the concepts that are inherently nebulous, things like philosophy.
95000	108000	How do we make it more scientific or to preach to people that want to understand things in a logical, rational, measurable or quantifiable manner.
108000	118000	I can give a couple of examples of that kind of approach working, so I'll run that through.
118000	128000	The second one is that tomorrow is actually the 100th anniversary of Sukumar Ray's death.
128000	134000	He is a huge impact in my life, so I've been thinking of paying some kind of homage.
134000	144000	I don't know exactly in what way, what is appropriate and what I'm capable of, but in some way at least I'm trying to remember him.
144000	154000	The third one is kind of chalking out the lay of the land of metaphysics.
154000	165000	In a sense, what are the things that are worth covering that needs a modern reinterpretation or that we can kind of talk about or reflect on?
165000	175000	And what are the things, especially trying to find out, I am very concerned, what if there are things like blind spots that I have absolutely no clue about not knowing, essentially.
175000	178000	So what are the things I need to upgrade myself about as well?
178000	190000	So that is basically like putting each other on each other's blind spot and finding out what are the things that we both need to build up, so that then we can start filling up the details.
191000	194000	It's like a jigsaw puzzle, but the pieces are old.
194000	203000	We need to create new pieces that are not different, but the reinterpretation that fits better right now, essentially.
203000	209000	Something that we can distilled version, the PO version that we can also consolidate.
209000	213000	So those are the three topics that I think.
213000	216000	How do you think?
216000	230000	Yeah, I think I would have switched the order and put Shukumaraya first and then progressively from there, because I feel like that itself is like the seed to begin with.
230000	235000	It is, in a meta sense, it is.
235000	250000	The very reason that I will speak in a selfish way, because I don't know many people who have walked a similar kind of pathway.
250000	270000	So in that sense, growing up in an environment that is kind of academic, but have seen or perceived the necessity to become a careerist, but then again understood the necessity of the concept of absurdism, like the surrealism.
270000	287000	Like why, at which point that rampant rationalism falls apart and you need that support of the fun in life without which you can't proceed, like life becomes very bleak.
287000	289000	You cannot rationalize that part.
289000	296000	Sometimes no matter how well you do things, you still lose, at which point all you can do is laugh at it.
296000	302000	And like I'm probably not putting it the right way, but I've seen that thing and it was always challenging.
302000	307000	I've seen people at various order, like various spectrum, but not most of the time.
307000	311000	I didn't see many people who covered the whole spectrum, whole of it.
311000	323000	So it was always challenging for me to communicate with people on the entire spectrum who understand the rational world as well as Viralaya Talibhusha.
323000	327000	So that part is where I come along.
327000	338000	So not only the challenge that I have is exactly that you are seeing is that I cannot put that into words partially because I have no practice of it.
338000	345000	I haven't spoken to people with whom I can talk about it because there was no option for that.
345000	357000	Now I am going to hand it over to you and take that forward, like whatever I didn't or I failed to say, what are the parts that you can cover on this particular topic?
357000	373000	So I think if you start with the absurdist literature in its truest form, let's say, well, truest in the sense like let's take a narrow track here, Shukumarai specifically.
373000	380000	That the absurdism when I grew up, like growing up, one of the first things I read in life was Hoja Borala.
380000	387000	And I think I'm forever grateful because the next thing I read in like the first Bangla I had read was Hoja Borala.
387000	390000	The first English I had read was Alice in Wonderland.
390000	405000	And I think that the combined impact of that made me feel like while these were told to me as children's stories,
405000	412000	I did think it is children's stories because I understood it. I felt like I understood that it resonated with me.
412000	418000	Like the Cheelo Rumal Hoye Galo Beral. It can happen. That's what it's about.
418000	428000	But then probably I remember the first time I came across the concept of a pun was Sri Baikarun Singh.
428000	434000	Like B.A. Baikarun Singh. B.A. because I am Bae.
434000	440000	But what I'm trying to say here is, yes, I do Bae.
440000	448000	I was like, okay, there's something here. But there was an interesting thing that happened to me at that point in life.
448000	454000	And again, I think we need to narrate very subjective experiences here and then see where the intersections are.
454000	461000	And one of them was I had this neighbor who insisted that I learn translation, who insisted with my parents,
461000	468000	that seems like your kid is able to grasp a language, which is ironic that I did not speak till the age of like two and a half.
468000	474000	I was a late bloomer in that sense. And I'm still a late bloomer in pretty much everything in life.
474000	480000	But in that sense, as in the primary language, your language. Yeah, like I could not.
480000	486000	I did not have vocal skills to the point that and even when I spoke, I stammered a lot.
486000	495000	Like I stammered a lot till like 17, 18. But what the translation gave me was I had Alice in Wonderland.
495000	499000	I had Alice in Wonderland on the other hand, and I had Hojo Borala on the other.
499000	506000	And then in true Robi Thakur fashion, I was given Hamlet to translate into Bangla.
506000	514000	Okay, I think I was five years old then. That did not catch my attention.
514000	523000	But I went back to Hojo Borala reading that. And I remember feeling this thing that I mean, I didn't understand what Hamlet was like first two pages in.
523000	529000	I was like, this is definitely not children's story. But this Hojo Borala is children's story.
529000	537000	I remember reading it back again around the age of eight, nine.
537000	542000	Feeling that, okay, I understand something more now. I had spoken the language for a few more years.
542000	546000	Then there was a long gap. I read it back again when I was 16.
546000	552000	And I thought, okay, because it was that old, dusted, heartbound book that I open and read and like, hang on.
552000	557000	This does not feel like children's story anymore.
557000	563000	This fellow trying to go like telling the road to Thibaut.
563000	565000	What was it?
565000	567000	Kolkata Ranaghat? Diamond Harbor, Thibaut?
567000	573000	Diamond Harbor, Thibaut.
573000	580000	So I had some sort of understanding of geography and the way it was going.
580000	584000	So what happened? The click that happened, there was why.
584000	592000	Because there had been the school, 10 years of schooling that had pushed into me that rationality.
592000	596000	Maths, the way it was taught, had taught me logic.
596000	603000	And then I was like, this is the framework and scientific methodology.
603000	607000	All combined together made it feel like an obscure way of looking at things.
607000	613000	But then the why quickly became why not?
613000	619000	And that is also what connects to Zoidberg.
619000	622000	So I realized that there is something happening here.
622000	626000	And the main thing is, it was no longer a children's story to me,
626000	631000	but there was a certain comfort in that absurdity that when all else fails,
631000	639000	and age of 16 was one of the most disastrous periods of my life, academically, family, everything together.
639000	644000	And it was a situation in which all else had failed.
644000	650000	And the answer to what else was why not take the long route to Thibaut?
650000	652000	And kind of I hang on to it.
652000	655000	Okay, the main thing is what? I need to go to Thibaut.
655000	657000	I'm currently in Ranaghat.
657000	660000	I might as well go to Diamond Heart, but then go to Thibaut.
660000	664000	Whether I find Kesavadada or not.
664000	676000	And that, the power of that absurdism there took me, I think, I probably reread, I have never reread Haujaborala.
677000	680000	And I read it back to back a few times.
680000	685000	And each time it felt like there were layers upon layers upon layers of what was happening.
685000	692000	That this was not just, I mean, it's like you come to this absurdism with just for the humor.
692000	694000	We'll get just the humor.
694000	698000	You come to it to defy logic, you will get the defying logic.
698000	701000	Come to it for fun, you get that.
701000	713000	But most of all, to me, it was like when all else fails, what is that framework that will allow me to still make sense of what was happening around me?
713000	721000	In many ways, this is a form of dissociation, like absurdism is a form of dissociation from reality.
721000	729000	And the power of the dissociation is you have disconnected from the finite rules that you were bound by.
729000	733000	And for me, it was also psychological manifestation happening at the same point.
733000	743000	And that kind of brought me, and the only way I want to sum that up is, then I went back to Abul Dabul.
743000	746000	And the last poem hit me.
746000	749000	That one, that one slaps.
749000	752000	And since then, yeah, it is.
752000	757000	And by then I knew of the story, by then I knew of the history of what had happened.
757000	767000	And then it hit me that that same mind is saying this is practically on his deathbed.
767000	771000	Yeah, that's what is like.
771000	776000	That's when you actually get the hits you in a way.
776000	778000	Hang on a moment.
778000	785000	In the other parts where same or similar tone or like the frequency have hit me,
785000	794000	this guy was not basically laughing from his cheek to cheek or ear to ear, whatever the notion is.
794000	805000	But he was trying to make something that is very grim or very bleak and laying it out in front of you at the hope of...
805000	812000	So here's the thing. Nonsense is basically when nothing makes sense, how do you make sense of it?
812000	817000	You were saying that at the end of everything else stops making sense.
817000	820000	How do you still reconcile? How do you still keep on going?
820000	823000	That's where that nonsense strikes.
823000	831000	That's where it tries to, even if null is a data type here.
831000	834000	So I will expand on the null part.
834000	838000	So that's how that's when it actually happened, occurred to me.
838000	845000	Like, hang on, not only there's more to it, that part is the more essential part.
845000	854000	And the rest of it is basically an act like passing it along as a children's story or children's book or children's poem,
854000	857000	all those things so that he can publish it in Saunders.
857000	864000	But it is so much more for the parent of that child as well as for that child.
864000	869000	For me, I was...
869000	872000	See, it's not 8 years and 3 months or something.
872000	874000	How old are you? 8 years and 3 months?
874000	879000	I was 8 years and 3 months when first time reading it.
880000	887000	It was weirdly, almost somebody sent a time capsule knowing that,
887000	894000	hey, this guy, I need to hit him where it properly...
894000	898000	This particular, what do you call that thing? People pinch needles, right?
898000	901000	The Chinese acupuncture?
901000	902000	Yeah, acupuncture.
902000	906000	So it's almost like we need to acupuncture this guy at the exact right spot.
906000	913000	So we should hand this book over to this guy and make him read this part when he's 8 years and 3 months old.
913000	916000	And read this part and then it hits him.
916000	921000	If I did not read those kinds of things, there's some very curious stuff that happens, right?
921000	926000	And at that point, is this meant to happen? Is this some kind of destiny?
926000	932000	Should I be more concerned, more careful, more focused about exactly what I am...
933000	936000	I kind of felt gratitude after that point onward.
936000	941000	Like, hey, most people at my time, at my age is not doing this.
941000	943000	They're missing out.
943000	946000	Don't want to look at it in a very different way.
946000	949000	I should be thankful that I can enjoy this.
949000	952000	Nothing else. I can read this. I find this funny.
952000	954000	I find this enjoyable.
954000	957000	I don't need a big meaning or anything else at this point.
957000	963000	And I just want to find it interesting and entertaining enough and more like it, essentially.
963000	970000	That probably created the bandwidth for which now then I can enjoy Python as comedy.
970000	975000	Same or similar, I would say, in a sense, right?
975000	978000	We start with something, we end with something.
978000	980000	Neither of those things make sense.
980000	984000	But overall, it's a social commentary that is objectively funny.
984000	988000	And you can project it any different ways you want.
988000	990000	All of those ways would be funny.
990000	994000	And neither of those would be objected by the author themselves.
996000	1000000	That was how I was seeing it.
1000000	1002000	I was really bad at...
1002000	1004000	Yeah, go ahead.
1004000	1007000	Sorry, I just wanted to tie back the thing you said about null, right?
1007000	1012000	So nonsense, then the interpretation of it became not as not sensical.
1012000	1014000	It became beyond sense.
1014000	1022000	And however, the question that comes up, then what is the sense that we are talking of in this context?
1022000	1027000	Is it sensory perception beyond the limits of sensory perception?
1027000	1041000	Is it sense as, going back to our maxims, as commonly accepted social principles as the sense that anything that is beyond those commonly accepted social practices,
1041000	1058000	or is it that the sense here is in a way that anything that has meaning and a forceful breaking down, deconstruction of that meaning,
1058000	1064000	so again, in that sense, beyond sense, that what lies beyond sense,
1064000	1079000	so if I throw language beyond the boundary of common usage, if I try to use language beyond the boundaries of perception, of rationality, of societal understanding, of accepted knowledge,
1079000	1082000	what does language become?
1082000	1096000	And that is where I think the fluidity, you know, that playing with the language comes in, because you have then abstracted the concept of the ability to express anything based on certain parallels.
1096000	1110000	So in that sense, that way of application of language is very similar to how generative AI works, that it's just predicting.
1110000	1121000	It's just taking a set of items, converting that into a series of other data type that you just can't understand, and then patch that back.
1121000	1130000	And so I just want to say that what that said, and I think at that, that was also the point I was learning programming seriously in life.
1130000	1144000	And I realized the importance of null. And I realized how much of a pain the null pointer exceptions were, how much was the undefined behavior that acted,
1144000	1161000	but in all, I think it has still stayed that I still look at null as this concept of a nonsense, like a beyond sense, beyond definition, and nothing really cemented that concept in me as strong as Shukumar guy's writing has.
1161000	1181000	Because in a sense, null is a conscious choice. It's not that something failed. Null is a conscious choice of the developer to keep it that way from everything else, like undefined can be different thing.
1181000	1193000	Zero can be different. When it's null, that means the developer shows it to be null. It doesn't happen like out of the blue.
1193000	1205000	I think one of the ways to put it would be think of a jigsaw puzzle, like lots of pieces, right? The puzzle that hasn't been solved yet, a new thing.
1205000	1217000	When you're pushing the boundary, a new layer of the land, you haven't mapped it out yet. So you have a jigsaw puzzle where there are pieces, nobody knows what the correct order is.
1217000	1238000	Now, there's a playful entity going ahead and creating Bokochop or Hansjaru out of that, because nobody knows what the right answer is. The sense has not been laid out yet.
1238000	1250000	Out of all those Bokochops and Hansjarus, there would be eventually discovery would be made. Hey, this is the one that is a solved puzzle.
1250000	1259000	This is the one that is out of all those random trials and errors to some of them are funny, some of them are not funny.
1259000	1269000	This is the one that is for these people who only want the sensical stuff. They would take that and they will run with it.
1269000	1277000	That would be the part when this part is understood, at which point people like Sukumar Rai would not find that domain funny anymore.
1277000	1287000	They would want to push further down the line, because that part of the map is now known map. Now it has been chalked out or mapped out.
1287000	1309000	I saw that anything from a social norm, cultural weirdness to everything else, I forgot the particular story where he goes to Hindukusha Parvatmala finding weird kind of animals and stuff.
1309000	1320000	It critics or criticizes the people like the Western explorers going to Africa and their accounts and how they know it.
1320000	1333000	It is telling a story. It is being funny as well as at the same time it is showing that how absurd does it seem to everybody else if it falls to a normal person's hand.
1333000	1344000	What does it look like or sound like to them? You cannot say this author's writing is good and this author's writing is BS.
1344000	1354000	How do you distinguish, how do you quantify that? You don't know that. At that point both of them are true, both of them are right.
1354000	1359000	You are just assembling the puzzle pieces in different ways.
1359000	1369000	So that is how another way to see the nonsense that I have seen is that not only always it is null, it can also be how many ways can I break the game.
1369000	1381000	And by doing that, finding out this one way the game is not broken, this is the way it is the actual interpretation. Luckily sometimes you end up finding it.
1381000	1399000	Which is where the success of and the departure of nonsense, when that happens for any particular small domain or subset of case, that's when nonsense exits that, no longer my territory.
1399000	1413000	Since I have been found here, now I need to push the boundary through. Anyways, I think, so I have been, so do you have anything else? Otherwise I was going to talk about.
1413000	1425000	So I posted one thing in chat, did you see that? Channel called A-Bong. You are muted, so I cannot hear what you are saying.
1425000	1429000	I thought that was a link for this stream.
1429000	1442000	No, no, no, no, no. So I was trying to go, like start the stream, but it was asking me for, because it's a new channel, it was asking for authentication and enabling streaming, etc., etc., all those things.
1442000	1458000	So I had to go back to the other channel where you already streamed there. It's being streamed there. For the time being, I know that we probably can do a better job at exactly consolidating all those things, but I think it's still possible.
1458000	1462000	But is this the URL where it is, like the channel in which this is streaming now?
1462000	1478000	No, no, no. I cannot. YouTube won't allow me without like, you have to give the mobile phone number, it takes 24 hours to set up, all those things I was not sure. It was not there before. They started it new.
1478000	1494000	So I started, like I tried to stream there, and it said that no can do today. So you said that it would be better if we record, so at least the new, like the stream is being recorded, so that's that.
1494000	1511000	But that channel would be the one where I'm thinking of publishing, starting with Abol Tabol, like the abriti. So I'm doing something, I'm doing something, so that seemed like the lowest hanging fruit.
1511000	1531000	Going forward, we'll keep on adding more stuff. It's not really only Sukumar Rai or anything. The idea is Bengali literature has not found as much online exposure in this kind of media.
1531000	1552000	Or maybe I just want to see how much exposure, whether this kind of exposure actually works. I don't want that for kids part. I don't want to make it for kids. I want to make it for adults, for people like the post teenage and then some.
1552000	1572000	So the people who are trying to now rediscover themselves, for them to grab onto content that are not only somebody else's language content, but their own language content, which it has a rich history. Why not use that?
1572000	1594000	So that way, but along with that, so all those, all those things will be like Ebong Satyajit, Ebong Sukumar, Ebong Robi Thakur, Ebong Adda. So I was thinking of like, if we can make this or this thing more generic, general purpose, and just post it as like Ebong Adda, or maybe we can use a different branding.
1594000	1611000	Ebong Adda sounds right to me, like as in okay to me. It's like a huge spectrum, like it can go anywhere pretty much. We are open to discuss pretty much anything. So and then maybe have guest, maybe not have guest, maybe we just go on about it, whatever we want to discuss anyway.
1611000	1631000	And have that as a repository for that, that we can round back to, that is as a live stream. Sounds good? Yep. Any changes that you'd want to make as in as a conceptual, concept wise?
1631000	1660000	Not really. But something that occurred to me, just to like bring up in this context, right, that we are talking of Satyajit Rai in the context of that Chhoto Dergol for children's literature. And the one thing I have always felt, and I guess a lot of people feel, but then forget as they grow old, is this contempt for grownups, that why does there need to be a separate children's edition, which is jingly, colourful.
1660000	1689000	And then should get as grim as you grow older. I was the kid who liked less colours, brighter colours bothered me. So I was like, am I already a grownup? Because I like those grim themed things. But the one thing about Shukumarai's work, and in that sense, I guess it's also shaped how I see, you know, the human consciousness in that sense is the child stage is just a vastly,
1690000	1717000	fast learning version of the same self. It's almost like the rate of learning peaks and then slowly grades down. And there are psychological analysis to back that up. But I'm seeing the literature or the even the, you know, the way you deal with children, one of my gripe always has been how people do bababacha to kids.
1717000	1740000	And I never do that. To me, that's an individual to me, or whether part of a collective or not, but that person deserves a certain amount of respect, because who am I to suddenly think that I know better than this person that I have certain new, I know everything that this mind can think of and most of the time it turns out not.
1740000	1765000	Because again, a young mind is more capable of thinking in nonsensical terms, because it has got lesser amount of sense to unlearn to get there. So the ability for an author or to for somebody to, you know, maintain that level, I mean, yeah, I understand that there are certain things that can be hazardous that, okay, somebody has not learned something.
1771000	1778000	That would you go and give warp technology to somebody who's just invented metals?
1778000	1789000	And the answer is, yes, you can. But the probability of mishaps go like proportionately higher.
1789000	1806000	Yeah, but then there is that same infantilizing in our narrative of history, especially of anthropology, when we look back at the Bronze Age, at least the way we would, at least the way I was taught in school, it was as if they were infantile humans.
1806000	1817000	And slowly we became adolescent humans. Now we are grown up humans. So if I was born at that age, I would have considered right now. Yeah, the best.
1817000	1828000	We are the best. We are the best. We are done. We are done developing. We're done growing up. Right. That is the part that gets me and it makes me really mad. Like, I am with you so far.
1828000	1853000	Right. So, okay, we were very underdeveloped and all these things. But to consider that now we got this and now there is no part. That is the part where to ground back to your point, what you are saying is that the crystallization of self or identity or even the concept of reality itself, the crystallization is what growing up traditionally has been.
1853000	1876000	Growing up is nothing else than the crystallization to lack the fluidity. So the reason we are a little bit mad about the whole thing is because we have retained that neoteny of flexibility, that fluidity among ourselves, within ourselves.
1876000	1889000	And we prefer to keep it that way, which is why it was not beaten out of us in the right amount of time. We kind of have been able to retain that during that period.
1889000	1905000	So, which is why now we have more stronger will to continue that because we can see the benefit of it. Think of the, like, the alternative timeline where it has been during the school age has been beaten out of us.
1905000	1915000	And we don't even know what you are missing out that neoteny. Our identity is strong and we're like, no, this is the best we can ever be. There is nothing else to learn.
1915000	1926000	Everyone else who says anything else about what doesn't match with our understanding, they're just plain wrong and they should be put in jail or something like that.
1926000	1940000	Anyways, point here is that's exactly what death of childhood is. To me, childhood is not just one individual identity that should be respected.
1940000	1957000	The concept of childhood itself should be respected the same way and retained as much as possible because once you lose that, you fail to see what you what you're missing out.
1957000	1968000	So I'll give it back to you for the part that you are saying that why you think that children's books, the separation of that, you're not okay with that. Please continue on that part.
1968000	1972000	I don't think you finished that part.
1972000	1996000	I mean, I had finished that. But the point, the thing I was talking, trying to point out is this concept of linear evolution and the concept of linear evolution being applied to human history, being applied to education, being applied to the growth of an individual within a society, being applied to a carrier progression everywhere.
1996000	2007000	It's that linear time is easier to understand. It's easier to understand key in the past we were conquered and now we are free.
2007000	2015000	Like, yeah, in the past, we were conquered by various invasive forces who right now we are free.
2015000	2041000	Well, but then on the other hand, the specific part about children's literature that really bothers me is it assumes a certain level, a certain step after step of learning that as if somebody is going to learn these concepts about even let's say, what is a biological sex?
2041000	2057000	What is gender? What? How do you actually reproduce to how do you then build a society? How does this like who's to say in what order somebody is able to understand that?
2057000	2077000	And for example, as a child growing up, I found that I understood maths faster than I understood literature. But I was not allowed access to higher order mathematics, which means that in class four, I was solving the maths books of my cousins who were in class 10.
2077000	2087000	And they thought I was showing off. At the same time, I could not give a literary analysis.
2087000	2112000	What are the most stupidest questions? Like, I was not good at bullshitting. So I was I was good at those kind of questions. Like, yeah, bring bring that. Do you know the right answer? Like, has the did the author talk? If they haven't spoken anything about this? So whatever I say, you cannot say no.
2113000	2135000	Yeah, I mean, what I'm trying to say is that see, a lot of push in educational reform today is also around bringing a more inclusive education to the current generation. And I'm talking of outside the mainstream education.
2135000	2156000	And my partner works in that a bunch of people I know work in that area. And one of the common themes I keep on hearing is empower the learner. Let the learner create their own curriculum, where the educator is simply the safeguard, as well as the facilitator, the safeguard for the boundary.
2156000	2182000	So basically, the very strong prime directive in the Star Trek prime directive in the form of non interference needs to apply for the healthy growth of an individual. And from that part, what I want to say is that anything that I think we say, the issue with censorship is that it, again, I'm probably starting to sound like Zizek at this point.
2182000	2195000	But yeah, praise be Zizek. What I'm trying to say is that the censorship really is this higher moral ground of this holier than thou attitude that I know what is better for you in exactly this order.
2195000	2218000	Till you cross that threshold, you are not allowed to experiment with this. But suddenly after that, you must. Like suddenly after the age of 18, you must vote in one day, you need to understand what is politics, who is the right candidate to choose. You're not allowed to drive till 16 or 18, depending on where you are.
2218000	2222000	17 years, 360 days.
2222000	2224000	Yes.
2224000	2248000	And that's like, what this cuts across is in my work, I do not distinguish based on the age. I always distinguish based on, it's like the prerequisites can be almost said in form of a software dependency. Do you have this, this, this and this? That is what you need in order to run this because that's sort of the library I'm drawing from.
2248000	2254000	Unless you know that, you won't be able to understand, which is again a knowledge graph.
2254000	2273000	This is one of the most important or interesting topics to me. There are only a handful of few topics that I am very much invested, I want to do something about it to the point, there are things that I know that this is important, somebody should do something about.
2273000	2279000	This is one of the topics like the education system, like reformation of education system.
2279000	2292000	I don't know, I don't have all the answers, but I know enough of those things that seem absurd, and there needs to be like, there are easier solutions there than the ones that are being employed.
2292000	2307000	I know that part, and what I am pining for essentially is people with similar kind of mentality, and there's another challenge there is that handling a child is an ethical concern.
2307000	2316000	Whose child are you giving those values and how they are turning out to be, it basically becomes your responsibility.
2316000	2332000	And even though you are very sure that what you are doing is a bona fide, like your good faith basis you are doing, trying to do the right thing or best thing that you think you can do, but truth is a shared understanding.
2332000	2339000	If everybody says that's wrong, then you're wrong, you will be tried for malpractice.
2339000	2342000	So how do we change that layer of the land?
2342000	2371000	So before we get to actually like giving curriculum to kids or facilitating that, a lot of groundwork needs to happen to make that a norm, like this alternative mechanism as a norm, and some bold parents to actually stand up and to do that, like to contribute to that and show that as like, hey, see, this is the results that we are getting out of these practices.
2371000	2384000	Which will take another generation or something in order to start, like best case scenario, but it has to start there, it has to start somewhere.
2384000	2403000	I just don't know how exactly, like, there's a reason I probably should not slack off on like meeting Sharon, like speaking to her about these topics. I think I should prioritize that.
2403000	2430000	In fact, she's gone to Bangalore for a related, she's doing a course which is in related educational field, and this is like a field study trip. But the one thing I just want to point out here, see, the good news is that a lot of work has happened already, and there is substantial ground for this to be considered a viable alternate.
2430000	2450000	I mean, even if you want to demean that and call it alternative, what I mean by demeaning is it's like saying that the mainstream is still the truth, and these are all truths. But there is a fundamental difference, and I see a very strong, very strong parallel in software engineering to it.
2450000	2470000	And I keep on drawing this line. So again, if any of them seem too far-fetched, feel free to stop me. There's a big focus of this kind of education system where you are empowering the learner. One is you don't necessarily, your only criteria rather is not the learner's age.
2470000	2485000	Your criteria is the learner's abilities and lack of abilities. Based on that, a lot of effort, the education is geared towards helping the learner build the curriculum, a sort of service discovery.
2485000	2502000	That in the software design paradigms, do you design services which explicitly know each other, or do you build a system that acts as service discovery? And then you plug in the different services, let the services discover each other based on the common thing.
2502000	2522000	So they're doing something very similar in education, that they are putting a lot of effort into helping the child learn, let curiosity lead the way, being one of the foundational principles with the facilitator guiding across. And again, I am not the expert here. I am giving you an external perspective into what I have observed.
2522000	2538000	But what this boils down to is the fact that you are not starting with a fixed curriculum. You have a certain set of milestones you would like to achieve, and the progression of everyone would not be the same.
2538000	2563000	So then a standard evaluation technique does not apply anymore. Your evaluation grows more towards a research oriented, so then kids don't give exams, kids write research papers, they choose a topic, they want to build something. You fix some aspects, you know, just like in service definition, you fix that, okay, this is the service discovery URL, this is the protocol it speaks, that part needs to be fixed.
2563000	2584000	So there is a lot of protocol design work that is happening in this sector right now. And a lot of new organizations are coming up. In fact, specifically, if you've heard of Teach for India, the one thing I know through Sharon, the founders of Teach for India have started something called the Circle Incubation, the Circle India something.
2584000	2601000	And what they are doing is acting as an incubator in the very way that we are familiar with in the startup world of incubating, you know, startups, except they're incubating educators of the next generation. They're incubating people who are building alternate education principles.
2601000	2626000	And this is happening in India. And the beauty is that there is a lot more scope within India to do this because of the variety, because of the diversity, because you can't just speak one language, you can't enforce one framework, but you have to build the discovery oriented learning and a research oriented evaluation into things, which is again not new.
2626000	2641000	You know, in our academic curriculum, we reach that only in like masters or postgrad or in PhD. But suddenly, I mean, I was made to believe that a PhD is this very difficult thing because you have to research.
2641000	2655000	You don't get a textbook that you mug up and go and write. You have to find what you want to learn, then you have to try to find how you can learn, then you have to learn that and prove that you have learned it. Everything is on you.
2655000	2678000	So, you know, it's not that these things did not exist. But the point is we break the age barrier, break the learner's basic, like the role of the teacher changes to being that Adi Guru version to like if there was such an Adi Guru, then that Adi Guru would be an encyclopedia.
2678000	2681000	That would also guide you.
2681000	2705000	And finally, the one tragedy, the other tragedy that I find very curious, I've been rewatching, rather I've been watching the original Star Trek, you know, greeting through the sexist metaphors, the racial metaphors that exist, but trying to look at what was being done, trying to look at it in the context of 1962 through 67 or 69, what it was.
2705000	2718000	That what was really going on that it has to be compared at par with what was and the new things that it says, and something still fall in place, which you see TNG kind of trying to rectify.
2718000	2727000	One of those things, I mean, prime directive is probably mentioned somewhere in season two, late in season two, till then it was called the non-interference directive.
2727000	2741000	And the directive is the prime directive is simply that a higher order civilization should not influence or contaminate development of a lower order civilization.
2741000	2747000	And the non-interference to be practiced as the prime goal.
2747000	2764000	And I think that prime directive applies very strongly to education, to the way we run our political systems, to the way we run our any like even at a family level, you know, that where does that leave you?
2764000	2777000	Because the prime directive also has scopes where you would override it, where you see constantly Jean-Luc Picard throws prime directive to the air every now and then that they are overriding their judgment.
2777000	2784000	So that is kind of a facilitator stepping in and saying that, okay, you might have said non-interference, but this is not safe.
2784000	2807000	There is also a judgment call, but just tying that together, the education aspect of things also need to be treated from the perspective of a discovery and the ability to explore what is beyond the sensical world that the learner knows already, because what else are you exposing them to otherwise?
2807000	2823000	But I think what's interesting too, what I don't have is an experiment in progress, which you have, like that you said, the bringing up a child as the ethical dilemma that at which point do you throw that in? What do you balance? And I think that's another perspective that I'm interested in.
2823000	2837000	So that's another topic I was not thinking that we can discuss today, but I'm happy to discuss that. So I actually had a couple of hypothesis in my mind.
2837000	2852000	One of the things that you said that you learn to speak later in your life as in like two and a half, two, two and a half. So what I found is that, okay, this discussion is a bit longer or like a larger context. Let me establish the context, right?
2852000	2874000	So I was never convinced that intellect is the like from Alpha to Omega of what people's capabilities are. There needs to be, there is, there are more things to it than what IQ measures.
2874000	2901000	What are those things? Is there a comprehensive, like, like, can you map it out? Can you chalk it out? What are those things that one mind can handle? You are employing your neurons to do, and sometimes your neurons can decide, I am not good at this, or rather, I don't want to be good at this. I want to be good at this other thing.
2901000	2916000	Right? So it always struck me as a choice. And I have seen that most of the time, people would choose some or the other at the cost of some other things.
2916000	2938000	People who are really good at reasoning, problem solving, like the visual, like, or ordering of stuff, those are the traditional IQs. They would also have, most of the time, they would not have too many other things, but sometimes they would be good linguists as well.
2938000	2954000	If they are good linguists as well as good, like, higher IQ, they might even be in an autistic spectrum where they have really poor social interactions and stuff. Good at language, but poor at communicating.
2954000	2969000	There are people who are good at communicating, good at communicating, would stand up there on stage and speak very well, but then small talks will get completely fumbled.
2969000	2990000	So what I'm trying to say is that there are lots of different aspects to it. All those things are basically your brain deciding, I want to reshape myself in a way, this becomes, this XYZ becomes my first path, and those other things, I am not really interested so much about it.
2990000	3006000	The moment your brain decides that, it will start reshaping itself in that manner, to the point it will re-optimize itself over and over and over, to the point I am bad at maths, nobody starts being bad at maths.
3006000	3026000	Somebody at childhood deciding that I want to use those neurons differently, eventually finding that I can't really use those neurons anymore, they help me read somebody's facial expression better and understand whether they are in pain, are they hiding something, etc.
3026000	3042000	So I'm just, it's not the exact one-inch-to-one relationship, what I'm trying to say is that we, brain is a very highly flexible machine, the computer, and we can decide whether to crypto-mine with it or get more frames on a video game.
3042000	3066000	You can choose, you cannot do both at the same time, you get to choose. Now that was the hypothesis, which was fueled by, I got more fuel on that hypothesis while Rai was born around that time, so there is a thing called cognitive trade-off hypothesis, I think I talked about this a little bit.
3066000	3095000	So some shims can identify, like they have very highly visual persistence, so if you show for a one-tenth of a second, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 on the screen, and then you wrap them up with just dots, and they understand the concept of, over the time of practice, they know which one is the order, like 1, then 2, then 3, they will just go and touch-screen, go through all those things.
3095000	3105000	After that, near-perfection, not near-perfection, perfection, I haven't seen them make that mistake, they do that very well.
3105000	3126000	So humans can't. You will have to be like, if I show you 10 numbers on a screen, random places, for 10 seconds, and then wrap it up with white markers, then you probably will be able to find up to 5 or 6 or 7 after practice.
3126000	3148000	And it's not your shortcoming. The point is, the point that they're trying to make is that we abstract too hard in our brain. It does not make sense for us to have that consolidated, static information like that, and recognize that as is.
3148000	3157000	But we had that. We have had that ability. We chose to drop it. We're trading it off for a higher level of abstraction.
3157000	3176000	So when you're trying to communicate somebody, there were 10 dogs chasing me, like half a kilometer behind there, I need your help, you're trying to communicate that information, the exact positions of those dogs are not really as important anymore.
3177000	3188000	What is more important, how do I very succinctly transfer that information to you, so that now you get to help me, and we can together drive off those dogs.
3188000	3197000	But if I was solo, I would have benefit of knowing exactly how many of those are right behind me.
3198000	3205000	So those critical bits of crystallized details are not really important anymore.
3205000	3217000	What I'm trying to say in a roundabout way is that we create more and more higher level of abstraction, and by doing so, we trade off our superhuman traits.
3217000	3223000	If somebody can do those number-clicking as fast, we'll call that person superhuman ability.
3223000	3238000	Some people do that. Some people who are autistic but have savant-like abilities can tell you exactly 1969 to 2nd April which weekday was it.
3239000	3253000	Those people are hyper-using, utilizing their part of the brain to do just that, whereas trading off something else, maybe their social life is struggling, suffering, or maybe...
3254000	3272000	So my point was, can I create a situation where it seems like autism, and does that allow bandwidth for something else?
3273000	3283000	So I intentionally, I don't know whether you have seen that, so when she was 6 plus, no sorry, almost 8, she was starting to speak.
3283000	3298000	I took that, that she can take instruction, ta ta ta da da da, whatever I'm saying that she's saying back, so I took a video of that recording as a proof that she can speak, and she can follow the instruction.
3298000	3310000	If I'm asking her to say some specific thing, she'll say that, but then I completely cut her off from focalizing things like learning language, I completely cut her off from that.
3310000	3326000	What happened is that, so my idea was, most people, if we are trying to learn language, basically, visual processing, language processing, those two things take up huge amount of processing power of our brain.
3326000	3343000	And if we ground up at the very childhood, we overburden ourselves with those things, I cannot tie her eyes, but if I can make sure that the need for language is reduced, then how else does it manifest?
3343000	3350000	Because it's a very flexible machine, it will find out other things to process, if you don't give something to process.
3350000	3367000	So turns out, she is good problem solver and conscientious, all those things, as well as something that is completely oddball opposite end of it, she is also very good impact.
3367000	3376000	And those two things happened, she would not be able to explain how or why or what, but she will know somebody needs coming down.
3376000	3387000	She is better than both me and her mother combined on that aspect, and has been since as long as you can remember pretty much.
3387000	3395000	So she understands human better, she understands problem solution, those things better.
3395000	3406000	And the cost that we needed to pay is that up to three years old, she didn't speak in complete sentences anymore.
3406000	3411000	After that, we're like, okay, now you're time to get back on track.
3411000	3424000	Now, she understands only one language well enough to form proper sentences that is English, she uses English, like writing and reading and speaking all those things are normally Bangladesh.
3424000	3434000	She probably will expose her to that eventually.
3434000	3440000	The point is, you need to sacrifice something in order to get understanding of other things.
3440000	3443000	This was an experiment.
3443000	3449000	Now, I don't I would don't want to subject this experiment somebody else's kids to this.
3450000	3455000	But I wanted to take that risk and see exactly how does that manifest.
3455000	3460000	Probably someday she will blame me for the way it turns out.
3460000	3464000	There will be always everything has a good side and a bad side.
3464000	3467000	So probably she will find out a reason to be mad at me.
3467000	3473000	But I'm kind of I'm not too mad at myself for trying this out or figuring that part out.
3473000	3476000	She's still like I'm still running things.
3476000	3482000	I hopefully none of those things like would put her in a massive disadvantage in her life.
3482000	3486000	But yeah, that's pretty much where I draw the boundary.
3486000	3491000	Would I is it something that can be compensated after.
3491000	3495000	So that's how it has been so far.
3495000	3498000	Yeah, go ahead.
3498000	3502000	If you have some questions.
3502000	3505000	Just just some parallel observations, but that can wait.
3505000	3510000	OK, so I like so the entire ethical dilemma.
3510000	3513000	I understand that. I don't know how else to put it.
3513000	3517000	And I don't know how else to like I can let it go.
3517000	3519000	I can not run an experiment.
3519000	3522000	Nobody would be better for it.
3522000	3529000	So I don't know whether there's one good answer there.
3529000	3538000	With that said, it does seem like if you can't delay your language processing as well as visual processing,
3538000	3544000	and I did work on that as well, visual processing is not like tying up your eyes,
3544000	3550000	but the number of abstraction layers on visual processing like D and B,
3550000	3555000	the mirror ring identifying them as different.
3555000	3558000	If you can delay those kind of abstractions as well,
3558000	3563000	you actually have more bandwidth to process like learn other things faster.
3563000	3565000	You will eventually like learn that as well.
3565000	3574000	But what will happen is that more core neurons would be involved into like forming the baseline of the realities
3574000	3581000	and the baseline principles itself than just remembering solid facts, which is what ends up happening.
3581000	3587000	And once that ends up happening, like so what I mean by the core neurons,
3587000	3591000	so you see the hippocampus, the midbrain part, right?
3591000	3595000	So how do I go on about this much longer discussion?
3595000	3600000	OK, so if you consider in a very short form, there are three parts to our brain,
3600000	3604000	the reptile brain, the mammalian brain and the homo sapiens brain,
3604000	3608000	like the wrinkly part, the neocortex and stuff.
3608000	3615000	So the reptile brain, that part understands pain and fear,
3615000	3623000	disgust, sorry, not disgust, pain and fear and pleasure and like what's the opposite of pain?
3623000	3625000	Play, play, sorry, that's pleasure.
3625000	3629000	And what's the opposite of fear?
3629000	3635000	I forgot, but courage, courage.
3635000	3639000	I mean, it's like an absence of the drive, yeah, the drive essentially.
3639000	3647000	So that part is essentially most of the most of it is and the body functions,
3647000	3651000	like running heart at the right pace, et cetera, et cetera, breathing at the right.
3651000	3656000	Those things are happening from that small brain side of things, right?
3656000	3662000	The midbrain is the one that the hippocampus and the how do I show this?
3662000	3667000	Like somewhere around this, like if we cross that through or maybe look up the hippocampus,
3667000	3673000	the shape of it, we end up using it as a memory storage.
3673000	3677000	But it's not really a memory storage.
3677000	3682000	It is actually the map reduce section of the brain.
3682000	3685000	You can use it in a multiple different ways.
3685000	3695000	Anything that goes, you can put it as like map and reduce the actual the programmatic way of doing it.
3695000	3697000	Hippocampus will do that.
3697000	3706000	So you can not only remember facts, you can also remember methodologies itself or concepts itself.
3706000	3715000	So when we say why somebody is really good at a factory worker, right?
3715000	3719000	A factory worker, what would be their skill?
3719000	3730000	That hippocampus would be really good at doing that one thing over and over the particular move they are making to make more of the one thing that they can do.
3730000	3737000	And it will it will figure out a way to release dopamine and endorphin for doing that.
3737000	3743000	It will figure it will figure out to seek pleasure out of doing that thing over and over.
3743000	3746000	But for some people, that would not be the case for them.
3746000	3748000	They would figure out, I see.
3748000	3759000	So if I have these many people in this particular section of the factory that is just barely optimal amount of people that I need for that.
3759000	3764000	So if I put some of those people that are not really into it, they're causing more problems.
3764000	3774000	But put them into the like overseer role that might actually overall improve my output because now they're not problem of trouble makers.
3774000	3777000	They are now. So what will happen end up happening?
3777000	3784000	That guy will end up becoming the manager of the people who run the company or run the factory, those kind of ways.
3784000	3787000	That's what kind of ends up happening.
3787000	3790000	People who see more concepts and stuff.
3790000	3792000	How do you map, reduce and put them?
3792000	3794000	Some people in London tracks drivers.
3794000	3800000	For them, it's the spatial geospatial location itself is the thing that they need to store.
3800000	3803000	So all those things actually basically go are going into the hippocampus.
3807000	3812000	The reason I'm trying to say this is that memory, you can trade off on memory as well.
3812000	3814000	If you don't want to.
3814000	3819000	So hippocampus is like the processor of your computer in a sense.
3819000	3826000	It can have higher resolution, but lower number of and lower frequency of data.
3826000	3829000	So your brain waves.
3829000	3837000	That's the reason memory constellation happen when you're sleeping is because it's actually running the neurons through the exact set of drums.
3837000	3842000	That will happen in order to recall that memory.
3842000	3847000	So brain waves are basically the clock signals for your brain.
3847000	3849000	They're happening all the time.
3849000	3856000	And if you want to recall something, you're basically training your brain as a particular set of dance to recall that information back.
3856000	3864000	While you're sleeping, your hippocampus and the midbrain part of things, they're basically consolidating that dance to associate with something.
3864000	3867000	It doesn't mean the older things are lost.
3867000	3877000	It's basically you're overriding, overwriting sometimes, which is why sometimes in the dissociative set, you can find out memories that are that you didn't think even existed anymore.
3877000	3889000	So anyways, whereas the front, this part of the brain is better at lower resolution, high frequency, like the systolic array, kind of like basically the tensor processors.
3889000	3891000	Right.
3891000	3893000	Like GPUs are tensor processors.
3893000	3902000	It's doing more processing, but it does not have the precision level is basically like eight bit, not 32, not 64.
3902000	3916000	Whereas the internal part that is 64, which brings me back to the initial topic that I was trying to say is that if you end up using those high precision neurons for just about remembering location data,
3916000	3928000	just about remembering old memories, et cetera, then they're being spent like they're being spent for something that that's not the highest potential that you can use them for.
3928000	3936000	Now, it is not that easy to either reshape or repurpose those memories.
3936000	3942000	You have to actually actively have to start forgetting things in order to train them or bring them up.
3942000	3945000	I don't need to remember the console, like stop solid details.
3945000	3950000	I just need to know the level of abstractions that goes on top of it.
3950000	3954000	And what is the fundamental theory that holds all of those together?
3954000	3965000	If you can now remember that you can put more of those things and it creates the fundamental layer that if a child from the childhood, if you if somebody starts starts doing that.
3965000	3968000	And if that becomes optimization factor, by the way,
3968000	3977000	it is insane how well you can teach your own brain to seek pleasure in doing something that it decided that it's pleasurable.
3977000	3979000	Like it decided it's pleasurable.
3979000	3981000	Now, it will decide when that happens.
3981000	3990000	I need to release endorphin to dopamine to seek it and endorphin when that happens.
3990000	3995000	If that happens, anything in the world can be pleasurable to us, too.
3995000	4008000	So for somebody who finds interest in doing maths as a class four student of higher education, there's nothing holding you back.
4008000	4012000	You can basically at that point, you're becoming a math machine.
4012000	4022000	Like if you have the right books and basically the pointers in front of you, you can start breaking grounds.
4022000	4025000	Usually that's where the blocker comes in.
4025000	4027000	Usually you're not allowed to.
4027000	4031000	Usually there's no like preset ways to go on about it.
4031000	4033000	Most people do not even try.
4033000	4035000	We want to be a more rounded person.
4035000	4037000	People, I don't see the problem.
4037000	4046000	The point is, if we start recognizing those factors and allow people who are like who already have figured out most of the times what you're talking about,
4046000	4052000	like allowing kids to build their own curriculum, allowing like letting them figure out what they're interested about, etc.
4052000	4055000	Sometimes kids do find that out.
4055000	4057000	Somebody wants to draw.
4057000	4058000	Somebody wants to do maths.
4058000	4061000	Somebody wants to translate books, whatever.
4061000	4062000	I don't know.
4062000	4063000	That's not the point.
4063000	4069000	The point is, if somebody has that interest, use that, utilize that as the driving factor.
4069000	4075000	In fact, you can use that as something as a treat.
4075000	4081000	Hey, I want to create you a more rounded person anyway, so you have to do the other thing as well.
4081000	4084000	But if you do this, you know what?
4084000	4088000	At evening, you get to do more maths.
4088000	4090000	I'll give you a class 11's book.
4090000	4094000	Now, it's a win-win condition in both ways.
4094000	4104000	We are really bad at, like traditional academic, like entire schooling mechanism is really, really, really bad at doing just that.
4104000	4108000	In fact, it works the opposite way.
4108000	4117000	It doesn't allow the learner to decide what they want to learn, like at all.
4117000	4120000	Yeah, sorry, rant over.
4120000	4122000	No, it wasn't a rant. It was beautiful.
4122000	4133000	In fact, like what I meant when you said I showed this, I was like, that's the amount of time I have so you can continue.
4133000	4139000	And again, I mean, this is what happens when we discuss.
4139000	4147000	So talking of the endorphin and things like right now, my brain has always identified that discussions with you are pleasurable.
4147000	4150000	So it tries to optimize for that situation.
4150000	4157000	When that happens, I went into this discussion today and feeling low because, you know, I will be alone.
4157000	4161000	I knew that once I step into it, it's going to work out.
4161000	4167000	I sat with trying to write the topics, trying to do some pre-work as like it's OK, we'll figure it out.
4167000	4174000	So that's like the brain saying that do not, do not give up on this.
4174000	4182000	But at the risk of validating everything you said so far, especially in the context of Rai,
4182000	4189000	If you I mean, I'd like to go into a few things here, mostly relating to my experience around this.
4189000	4191000	Do you think we can afford to have the time?
4191000	4193000	I have time.
4193000	4203000	So I had a very peculiar childhood in that sense.
4203000	4208000	It was a very big mixed bag, except I did not have this.
4208000	4216000	I did not have parents who looked at bringing somebody up in this way.
4216000	4221000	So a lot of these are take a shaker for me.
4221000	4229000	But that take a shaker, like when I look back, I realized that these are the boundaries that they did not need to be strict.
4229000	4238000	The areas where they were strict, the areas where I was not allowed to do certain things, that just these factors moved around.
4238000	4246000	So, you know, when I said that I learned to speak late, I don't remember I having a problem with that.
4246000	4252000	I remember everybody else around me having a problem with that.
4253000	4259000	But so what I'm trying to say is that me growing up, I was this utterly confused kid.
4259000	4269000	Because conflicting expectations from parents, from neighbors, from school and certain places where I did well from their excessive expectation.
4269000	4272000	So they were all blurred up.
4272000	4279000	But if I have to go back and redo, I would want to redo it in exactly the same way that you talked of.
4279000	4282000	Like I would rather that my parents knew this, you know.
4282000	4291000	So that's what I meant that at the risk of validating you, if I was the child, the pain of my childhood that I carry on.
4291000	4299000	I see myself feeling calm about the process that you talked of bringing up right.
4299000	4303000	And that is what I meant by the risk of validating you.
4303000	4314000	Because if I felt physically calm, if I were to place myself in that situation and feel that, OK, I don't see a friction because I did tradeoffs.
4314000	4317000	And that is what I wanted to come to, that I did tradeoffs.
4317000	4324000	And one of my earliest tradeoffs was, I guess, you know, we keep on coming back to maxims.
4324000	4328000	One of my earliest maxims in life was it's OK to forget.
4328000	4332000	It's never OK to stop thinking, to stop analyzing.
4333000	4338000	And so true. Yeah, 100 percent.
4338000	4341000	I'd rather forget and recalculate.
4341000	4353000	So I was that kid who would finish exercise copies after exercise copies of maths at a certain point, like the age of I think class two to five ish.
4353000	4356000	Something happened after class five. I'll tell you that later.
4357000	4367000	But the two to five, I finished exercise book after exercise book and I never remembered where I kept them because I did not need them because I was never going to look back at them.
4367000	4371000	What was important is at that moment, I had solved something.
4371000	4372000	I can solve it.
4372000	4373000	I can solve it.
4373000	4377000	Another time, five times it comes, I can solve it.
4377000	4379000	Like with a high amount of certainty. That's what matters.
4379000	4382000	Why do you have to remember anyway in that case?
4382000	4385000	And my favorite kind of maths were proving the formulas.
4388000	4398000	Like where I was like, OK, this is how people had come to this formula, especially in algebra that we were taught at that point, the classic case in our text.
4398000	4401000	And like, OK, this is what is happening.
4401000	4410000	And just going back at it, it was almost like rereading a story, seeing the characters form, even though you know what happens in the end.
4410000	4423000	The formula for me was like knowing what happens at the end of the story, but I will read it, that story anyway, which is also why I keep on maintaining till date that I am never bothered by spoilers.
4425000	4438000	I am never bothered by spoilers because I know there is a certain end state that you're building up to, certain formulas, so to say, the summarized theorized compressed version of what there can be.
4440000	4455000	Now, very interestingly, that maxim that it's OK to forget has been one of the most conflicting things in my life growing up because everybody around me had the exact opposite view.
4455000	4470000	So I criminalized myself. I went into, so this is where you know the conflicts in personality kind of emerge, that I was constantly trying to be that boy that everybody else wanted me to be.
4470000	4478000	Whereas behind the scenes, I was always forgetting things. So what did I cope with? How did I cope with that? I built knowledge systems.
4478000	4497000	I was like, guess what? I can forget, but I can write down my notes in a way that I can get back to that. And of course, Einstein's that famous story, whether true or not, validated it, that my driver, like Einstein's driver saying that even my driver can answer that, that I don't need to remember facts.
4497000	4508000	I used to think that it's a great big thing, but it's that in truth, I could never come out to anybody and say that I forget. It was not acceptable.
4508000	4526000	This makes me really sad because not only that this is the case for one kid where this has happened, this is happening at a large scale, at a mass scale.
4526000	4539000	A lot of those people, a lot of those kids would be so broken that they would not even be able to recall it the way that you are doing. They will be that far broken.
4539000	4557000	Yeah, so then that maxim evolved to it's okay to forget. It's never okay to stop thinking and analyzing, but it's critically important to remember certain things so as not to repeat the same things again.
4557000	4566000	When that happened, that was the knowledge base forming part. And I have a very interesting...
4566000	4575000	By the way, before that, maxims are the opposite spectrum of memory itself, like the solid memory that I was talking about.
4575000	4576000	It is, it is.
4576000	4581000	So once you start remembering the maxims, that's when you don't want to remember the details.
4582000	4593000	So again, which is why I cannot back this up with specific instances always. In very rare cases, I can give a specific anecdote, but in mostly this is the reason I speak big.
4593000	4603000	And I have had partners, I have had friends who have told me that everything you say seems like a lie, seems made up. It is made up.
4603000	4605000	That's the sensor problem.
4605000	4607000	It's not lie. It is made up.
4607000	4614000	Sensors want solid proof with receipt to show up.
4614000	4623000	The world has enough resolution that you cannot, can never capture it to the highest amount of fullest resolution.
4623000	4626000	You don't have enough memory for it. Nobody does.
4626000	4638000	So if by trying to remember things, you're subjecting yourself to a shallow view of the world or reality or only a part that you can bring or keep the receipts off.
4638000	4654000	Whereas if you start building the maxims, you can apply the principles like exactly the way you can apply operators on particular kind of equations, a gamma function, how a gamma function is solved.
4654000	4660000	You can say that if I can do it this way, I can just say that, OK, this is just half tea and your salt.
4660000	4664000	I don't have to do it all over again. I don't have to show the steps.
4664000	4669000	If you do this, the concept boils down to this.
4669000	4687000	And that concept is when but it makes a lot of people very, very uncomfortable, uneasy, the ones who are good at and have learned in that system to remember solid details with the receipts.
4687000	4691000	I have not found a solution to this problem.
4691000	4703000	The only solution that I can think of is just you need to not you need to even I need to like reduce that exposure because that that interaction does not go well.
4703000	4707000	I was coming to that. I was coming to that in many sense.
4707000	4711000	I feel like I'm five years old.
4711000	4722000	So I'm pretty much in some sense like because, you know, of the amount of learning and then the unlearning and then coping with it and then suddenly hitting this.
4722000	4736000	A certain level of clarity where the moment it gets back to that, you know, it's OK to forget as a very tragic aspect in relationships.
4736000	4744000	Because I would then evaluate relationships under the same parameters.
4744000	4747000	And I'm not just talking of romantic relationships.
4747000	4751000	I'm talking of any casual friendship. I'm talking of hooking up with somebody.
4751000	4756000	I'm talking of a teacher. I'm talking of a manager.
4756000	4765000	And I have till date never worked with a manager and never work nicely with a manager who insisted that I remember things.
4765000	4774000	I worked very well with managers who have been to who in who allowed me the space to think.
4774000	4778000	And even even if I have approached something previously, go over it again.
4778000	4782000	But anyway, I was I was trying to talk of something very specific.
4782000	4788000	And I think it's like finally in life, I have that clarity of I feel like that is past.
4788000	4797000	So right now, even though it's it saddens, it is a past thing because I feel like I have understood how can I not fall into that trap again.
4797000	4801000	So sort of becoming your own parent of sorts, allowing building that space.
4801000	4807000	And one of the fundamental aspects of it is reducing exposure.
4807000	4813000	It is choosing very and I always used to think that why am I bad at socializing?
4813000	4816000	Because I always say everybody is supposed to be good at socializing.
4816000	4821000	When I went into the concept of networking, why the hell am I bad at networking?
4821000	4826000	And then before you know it, I have a bunch of people I'm collaborating with.
4826000	4828000	Hang on. Where did this come from?
4828000	4837000	So a lot of that analysis has come together in this very cute childhood memory of my parents insisting that I learn to paint.
4837000	4842000	You know, as every Bengali kid, you have a drawing teacher.
4842000	4844000	I had a drawing teacher.
4844000	4853000	Looking back, I realized that was the only queer, non gender affirming person in the area that I was allowed contact with.
4853000	4857000	And I was shit at drawing.
4857000	4859000	But you enjoyed going there.
4859000	4867000	I enjoyed going there because that person never critiqued exactly.
4867000	4870000	My trees looked like lollipops.
4873000	4876000	Hang on a second. I might actually have just the thing.
4876000	4879000	Okay, go on. It will take me a while to find out.
4879000	4883000	So there was something happening.
4883000	4885000	My parents were very upset with that teacher.
4885000	4890000	You can't learn anything. What is your son doing? What is happening?
4890000	4893000	I go to a drawing competition.
4893000	4896000	I think I had told you that was one of my favorite anecdotes.
4897000	4899000	I draw a mango.
4899000	4901000	Okay, I'm like four or five years old.
4901000	4903000	I'm sitting on the floor.
4903000	4906000	My whole body is shaking.
4906000	4909000	I'm drawing there.
4909000	4911000	I've been drawing for half an hour.
4911000	4913000	What does it mean?
4913000	4918000	I'm like, this is conceptually a mango.
4918000	4921000	So what does one do?
4921000	4927000	The brilliant mind in me labeled it M-A-N-G-O.
4927000	4930000	Just in case you don't know, this is a mango.
4930000	4937000	So what happened as a result of that was I realized that why I liked going,
4937000	4939000	this is looking back of course,
4939000	4948000	that why I liked the drawing class while I was in there was I am a terribly visual thinker.
4949000	4955000	But my concepts, my visual concepts don't align with the real world.
4955000	4960000	They are at best gross approximations because unless very important,
4960000	4964000	I do not care about the final details.
4964000	4969000	Because to me, it seems that the lollipop is sufficiently a tree to me.
4969000	4974000	It can convey the tree-ness of a concept.
4975000	4978000	In fact, that's the concept of stick figure.
4978000	4982000	People who do not enjoy stick figure commons.
4982000	4988000	That's why when I hit flowchart, computing books,
4988000	4991000	these people don't know how to draw, but they're drawing.
4991000	4993000	They're drawing everything.
4993000	4995000	And they're like, this means decision.
4995000	4997000	This means storage.
4997000	5000000	No storage looks like this.
5000000	5003000	Tell me where a storage looks like this, right?
5003000	5004000	Exactly.
5004000	5006000	Where does the decision do this?
5006000	5011000	They just mean this side, this side, this side, this side, this side.
5011000	5014000	That's the utility of it.
5014000	5017000	And it's like, this is how I was drawing all along.
5017000	5018000	So let me just draw.
5018000	5021000	And since then, I think in flowcharts.
5021000	5024000	I conceptualize using flowcharts.
5024000	5028000	And I draw the most weirdest drawings.
5028000	5031000	But they still convey enough information to me.
5031000	5034000	So there are two things that you're saying.
5034000	5041000	But what I'm trying to connect back to is I chose that lack of granularity
5041000	5045000	at a very early age over choosing for the abstraction,
5045000	5049000	deciding to focus at an abstract level.
5049000	5053000	But also, in many ways, it's like going at warp speed.
5053000	5055000	I chose my destination.
5055000	5057000	My destination was kind of far.
5057000	5062000	So my option was beyond impulse drive, reach there in 200 years,
5062000	5068000	observe everything that is in the path, or go there at warp speed,
5068000	5070000	at which point the stars are just zooming past,
5070000	5073000	but the zooming past of stars that field itself is such a brilliant view to me.
5073000	5080000	So very recently, I had to convince somebody of a particular analogy
5081000	5089000	about this particular, as in the trade of how you make it.
5089000	5093000	The person was asking the question.
5093000	5096000	The guy is super smart.
5096000	5104000	But that sensory has to be solid sensory receipt for me to grab on to,
5104000	5109000	otherwise I'm at a loss of, I cannot go into the nebulous territory.
5109000	5112000	That kind of thing, right?
5112000	5116000	So when I make some predictions,
5116000	5122000	I'm saying that something like this kind of thing is going to happen.
5122000	5125000	Their problem is like, how can you know?
5125000	5127000	How can you possibly know?
5127000	5131000	There is no way to know that.
5131000	5137000	And my point was that is because you enjoy being in the midst.
5137000	5143000	You enjoy solving the maze as a player playing the maze.
5143000	5148000	What you're not understanding, not realizing is that
5148000	5152000	when stuck with the exact situation, when it hits me,
5152000	5157000	I immediately disqualify myself as a player,
5157000	5160000	take myself off to a bird's eye view,
5160000	5165000	and now that how you possibly know is not a question to me anymore.
5165000	5166000	What did it cost?
5166000	5168000	Everything. I'm not a player anymore.
5168000	5171000	I cannot get the same enjoyment of solving the problem
5171000	5175000	the way you would do the sense of element of surprise,
5175000	5177000	whether I should go this way or that way.
5177000	5179000	That element of surprise goes away.
5179000	5183000	But this is not confusing to me anymore.
5183000	5185000	Now I can clearly see.
5185000	5188000	In fact, that's what I'm good at.
5188000	5190000	That's exactly what I'm good at.
5190000	5194000	It took me quite a while to explain the concept like this,
5194000	5197000	because if you see that explanation itself is a nameless concept.
5197000	5199000	I am not physically moving up.
5199000	5201000	I'm just trying to convince the person that,
5201000	5205000	hey, there are different ways to look at it.
5207000	5210000	Sometimes communicating that becomes really, really difficult,
5210000	5212000	really, really hard,
5212000	5217000	and the challenge there is over 90% people
5217000	5221000	only wants to see the world that
5221000	5228000	the rest 10% are usually weird, awkward, secluded introverts
5228000	5233000	that you have to go and find out to make that friendship.
5233000	5236000	Otherwise, you cannot find them out.
5236000	5238000	They would exist in some shadows,
5238000	5242000	knowing that nobody else is like me, nobody else understands me.
5242000	5245000	But that's what struck me that,
5245000	5248000	hey, the world is run by people who are really, really smart,
5248000	5249000	but they have...
5249000	5255000	So Star Trek had an episode about people who have exactly this kind of...
5255000	5259000	So Shaka, when the towers, when the walls fell...
5259000	5261000	Shaka, when the walls fell.
5261000	5264000	Right? So if you think about that, what is it?
5264000	5268000	That is still date marked as one of my most favorite Star Trek episodes ever.
5268000	5270000	And on that episode,
5270000	5274000	I have shown that episode to pretty much everybody who I would call close friends
5274000	5276000	or even acquaintances, even dates.
5276000	5278000	And the response is that...
5278000	5283000	The response is the elicit, tells, leaps and bounds,
5283000	5286000	at least the information that is relevant to me about them.
5286000	5288000	So I kind of use that episode as an acid test.
5288000	5291000	I was like, let me categorize you, you know?
5291000	5296000	And your response to Timba, his arms wide,
5296000	5299000	people laugh, those who are laughing.
5299000	5302000	And of course, it can be humorous, I can appreciate that.
5302000	5307000	I mean, you have to understand that it is speaking to the other end.
5307000	5311000	It is for the people who do not speak the way,
5311000	5316000	only for the people who do understand the symbolism aspect of things.
5316000	5318000	For them, you don't need to go into the details.
5318000	5322000	It doesn't have to mean exactly...
5322000	5326000	The other set of people immediately take to it.
5326000	5329000	The next day they are like, Timba, his arms wide.
5330000	5333000	So that is the reason. I don't remember a whole lot of things.
5333000	5336000	I cannot tell you a whole lot of deals from Star Trek.
5336000	5338000	This I do remember.
5338000	5340000	Oh, it is because I rewatched this episode.
5340000	5342000	No, no, it is even for me.
5342000	5344000	Last was two weeks back.
5344000	5346000	I see, I see.
5348000	5351000	Completely understood, but that goes to show,
5351000	5354000	I am, of course, I don't want to remember a lot of things.
5354000	5356000	But this, I do remember.
5356000	5358000	I don't have an option, I don't have a choice.
5358000	5364000	This represents so much of me that it is worth remembering as is, right?
5364000	5367000	Because as you said, it works as a litmus test
5367000	5369000	to find out that exact set of people.
5369000	5372000	Either they already know or when they are first exposed to it,
5372000	5376000	would be like, oh yes, this is it.
5376000	5381000	So in either of the cases, the point that I was trying to make is that
5381000	5385000	that difference, the contrast is really stark.
5386000	5392000	And even though in that particular, in Star Trek,
5392000	5399000	there was a somewhat of a closure, somewhat of a resolution,
5399000	5403000	in real world, there actually isn't as much.
5403000	5410000	One side would turn the other side as clumsy and stupid and move on.
5410000	5415000	That's practically what is there to it.
5415000	5424000	And I guess what I'm trying to say is that I kind of relate to that other species.
5424000	5428000	And the initial, like in that same episode,
5428000	5431000	like until Picard actually figures that out,
5431000	5436000	others dismissing that we can't ever translate this language,
5436000	5438000	even with our sophisticated tooling,
5438000	5443000	is the response that I have gotten from society when I spoke in abstracts.
5444000	5447000	Which is why I always thought,
5447000	5452000	like instead of associating myself with that species,
5452000	5455000	I always try to associate myself with Picard
5455000	5461000	because it is fundamentally, if I do understand that, good.
5461000	5465000	But if I don't have the intent to understand that,
5465000	5470000	if I completely live in a denial of this cannot be understood,
5470000	5474000	then that's not the life I would want.
5474000	5480000	I would want the prospect of knowing the things that I don't know yet.
5480000	5482000	Sometimes, at some level,
5482000	5486000	I would be the people who do not understand or speak that exact kind of symbolism,
5486000	5490000	at which point I would want to have a mind open enough
5490000	5495000	for me to be allowed to download that thing.
5495000	5497000	Anyways, where I was going with this?
5497000	5500000	I was going with, yeah,
5500000	5507000	the percentages are really stacked up against that kind of communication.
5510000	5515000	It would be, this is one of those things that I would want to solve as well.
5516000	5522000	Find more people around me who can see this and understand this
5522000	5526000	and understand that, okay, we have a,
5526000	5532000	that person is not one of island because that's how it manifests.
5532000	5536000	Until you find somebody else like you on those kind of things,
5536000	5538000	for a better part of your life,
5538000	5540000	you basically don't know anybody else.
5540000	5544000	You just end up thinking that you are screwed up in some certain way,
5544000	5546000	which was my case as well.
5546000	5549000	And that has been a very,
5549000	5554000	I think in many a sense, low days still reinforce that.
5554000	5557000	It has been practiced for so long
5557000	5561000	that basically depressive spells just reinforce that thought.
5561000	5564000	But somehow now, coming out of depression,
5564000	5566000	the phases when they come out of depression, that goes away.
5566000	5569000	So it tells me that it's an acquired trait.
5570000	5577000	But I think one of the things that I,
5577000	5581000	hearing your story, that story is what I understand is that
5581000	5586000	you actually valued the people around you or surrounding you
5586000	5589000	a lot more, their opinion and their perspective
5589000	5592000	and whether they understand you or not.
5592000	5596000	I think that's a lot of part of your pain.
5597000	5599000	It is.
5599000	5603000	And I think that is why the conscious choice
5603000	5607000	to then reduce exposure kind of came to,
5607000	5612000	because I operate on this obsessive learner mode.
5612000	5616000	And to me, there was enough to learn from everyone
5616000	5618000	and everything around me.
5618000	5620000	I might be learning something different.
5620000	5622000	So I saw different worlds.
5622000	5624000	I saw different worlds in my family, in the neighbors' families,
5624000	5626000	in my cousins' family, in school,
5626000	5629000	in the families of my other schoolmates.
5629000	5632000	And I saw that there was enough to learn from all of these.
5632000	5635000	And I looked at it as it's up to me to assimilate
5635000	5639000	and make what I must out of those.
5639000	5645000	And the downside of that was I was opening myself wide
5645000	5650000	to even the drudge of the system,
5650000	5654000	not realizing that at which point I have started
5654000	5657000	mimicking the same things that those people are telling me.
5657000	5660000	Instead of being that observer,
5660000	5664000	I have now become the person living that.
5664000	5666000	So that is fair.
5666000	5670000	That is the kind of thing which needs either a full dissociation.
5670000	5672000	So that was my mental state at that point,
5672000	5675000	that why did my brain go into dissociation?
5675000	5679000	It needed some place to think quietly outside all of this.
5679000	5683000	Now I realize how important that is in life
5683000	5685000	to actually distance myself.
5685000	5689000	I was like, okay, let's deconstruct life,
5689000	5691000	deconstruct to the point where there is nothing,
5691000	5695000	and then build back from that and see what is it that I want to add.
5695000	5698000	And that has worked out pretty well so far.
5698000	5702000	So which is why I said that my life experience
5702000	5706000	would actually be validating the approach you are taking towards.
5706000	5709000	And it is simply that I had to choose that
5709000	5712000	in the face of many other obstacles,
5712000	5714000	and I would have very much preferred if those obstacles
5714000	5717000	were not put in the first place.
5717000	5720000	So what I am trying to say is that you might find
5720000	5725000	just saying that I felt like I understood English better
5725000	5727000	after I learned programming,
5727000	5729000	because I understood logic,
5729000	5732000	and I could apply logic in that way.
5732000	5735000	But at the same time, one of the things I felt like
5735000	5739000	I would be good at, but I have never made the time
5739000	5741000	to go into is sign language,
5741000	5743000	because I have trouble.
5743000	5748000	I know it is a conscious drain of my energy
5748000	5750000	when I am verbalizing.
5750000	5753000	So choosing to do these long conversations
5753000	5754000	are a conscious choice.
5754000	5756000	I know that is how much I am draining.
5756000	5758000	So I am consciously aware of that.
5758000	5761000	So that just makes me think that if somebody like Rai
5761000	5765000	would be more open to understanding a sign language,
5765000	5766000	not needing to verbalize,
5766000	5769000	not needing to work with things,
5769000	5772000	and maybe just get better at that,
5772000	5774000	just another form of expression,
5774000	5775000	and it doesn't hurt.
5775000	5778000	You can learn any other language later.
5778000	5782000	There is that much more value behind it.
5782000	5784000	But why I am saying why sign language?
5784000	5786000	It is not just the vocal processing.
5786000	5790000	It is that sign language makes you think in certain abstractions,
5790000	5792000	certain other categories of abstractions,
5792000	5796000	which don't directly map to your spoken language.
5796000	5799000	Right.
5799000	5803000	I think the influence right now,
5803000	5806000	she has blank slate in front of her.
5806000	5810000	We don't restrict her from doing anything practically speaking.
5810000	5813000	She can do pretty much anything we just observe.
5813000	5818000	What happens is that the form of entertainment she is consuming
5818000	5821000	kind of dictates where she is going,
5821000	5823000	or things that she is practicing, etc.
5823000	5827000	So Nakamo as like a girly Nakamo,
5827000	5832000	those kind of things she picks up now.
5832000	5835000	So again, that's a weird, longer story.
5835000	5838000	The gender norm gets imposed on essentially.
5838000	5841000	We are trying to keep it as fluidic as possible.
5841000	5845000	Like, okay, we are never going to tell you who you actually are
5845000	5847000	until unless you figure that part out.
5847000	5848000	Right.
5848000	5851000	So what ended up happening is that at the playground,
5851000	5856000	she had to assume a gender in order to proceed forward
5856000	5858000	because the kids did not know how to treat.
5858000	5863000	And the kids were given that from their parents and all.
5863000	5869000	So basically, it had to be applied on in order to proceed forward.
5869000	5870000	It was becoming a blocker.
5870000	5872000	It still is a blocker.
5872000	5874000	I don't understand why that is the case.
5874000	5875000	But that is the case.
5875000	5881000	I was trying to find out where does that gender identity come from?
5881000	5885000	How do you end up deciding that you are one or not the other?
5885000	5888000	I can share my experience here.
5888000	5891000	And again, maybe this would be parallel a lot,
5891000	5897000	at least if not parallel that some use case, let's say case studies.
5897000	5900000	So the way I have come to understand gender,
5900000	5902000	I have always been this confused kid, right?
5902000	5907000	Because something that I feel was very different from what others told of me.
5907000	5909000	And I have gone through phases.
5909000	5914000	I've gone through my genderable phase where I was like, I'm strongly trans.
5914000	5919000	Then I went through and that was like my late teenage.
5919000	5925000	Then it was like, oh, no, I have to identify as this cis man
5925000	5928000	in order to be accepted into the society.
5928000	5930000	And again, went into fuck that.
5930000	5935000	But at that fuck that, I mean, in between was this trying really,
5935000	5940000	really hard to play the game by the rules to see for once.
5940000	5943000	I mean, that was like my college days.
5943000	5944000	That's what I'm saying.
5944000	5946000	You trust the system way too much.
5946000	5947000	No, no, no, no.
5947000	5949000	I don't trust it now.
5949000	5953000	I'm just saying at that point, it was like, OK, it looks like my way is not working.
5953000	5954000	I'm clearly not getting across.
5954000	5956000	I'm just causing more confusion.
5957000	5961000	And then my college days were like, let's play by the rules.
5961000	5964000	And I realized that I got tired of that very quick.
5964000	5966000	That's not working out.
5966000	5975000	But how I describe my understanding of gender now is that it's a function.
5975000	5979000	It's just like I think of morality that it's a computed function.
5979000	5980000	You throw in parameters.
5980000	5982000	I'm going to give you an output.
5982000	5988000	So my favorite way of saying is that my gender today or my gender now is this,
5988000	5990000	like a bouncing volleyball.
5990000	5991000	That's it.
5991000	5996000	But what I'm trying to say is that that, however, hit a roadblock, that approach.
5996000	6000000	And I realized that there is a certain value in templatizing,
6000000	6005000	templatizing to my nearest possible accepted thing.
6005000	6010000	It's kind of like having avatars, you know, like in a game you have created a certain avatar.
6010000	6014000	And I'm like, OK, in this scenario, this is how I represent.
6014000	6019000	So now how I represent my gender is I consider myself non-binary.
6019000	6026000	And I consider myself non-binary from the very fact that I believe in breaking down binaries unless it is computing.
6028000	6034000	So in that sense, binary is just a matter of solidified state.
6034000	6036000	Is there an influx?
6036000	6042000	But then if you break down the binary, binary is the most bare basic solid form, the crystal.
6042000	6045000	Yeah. So my stupid person can understand.
6045000	6049000	So basically, that's why it helps to keep it that way.
6049000	6056000	Yeah. So in this sense, I'm just tying this back that this ties back to my understanding of nonsense that I said at the beginning of this discussion.
6056000	6059000	Right. It is beyond sense.
6059000	6069000	So in that sense, when I'm talking of non-binary, it is basically it's not saying that it's not it's not to be interpreted as not to.
6069000	6076000	It is to be interpreted as something that cannot be confined to two because it is beyond that.
6076000	6081000	It is beyond two. OK, so then this is my job.
6081000	6093000	So the way I express my gender now is that I would like to understand the recipient and portray according to that.
6093000	6097000	So there are some thumb rules I go by in terms of pronouns.
6097000	6108000	If it is an English speaking audience, I insist on they them because they're the necessity to break down binaries is that much more important in the usage of pronouns.
6108000	6116000	But when I am talking to a native Bangla speaker and they ask me, what pronouns do you use?
6116000	6122000	My answer to them is anything you want, because my mother tongue does not have a concept of gendered pronouns.
6122000	6131000	So I don't see the value of introducing an artificial thing there because Bangla does not need pronouns.
6132000	6142000	But the moment I'm talking to somebody outside the Bangla thing or outside a language or especially a language that heavily genders the pronouns and like then I would be like, here, just please be conscious of this.
6142000	6145000	But then also there is a matter of presentation.
6145000	6154000	So the gender is an identity. There is a presentation there is as in the internal and the external aspect of it as well.
6154000	6166000	So the presentation part, I realized that there are certain ways of presenting myself in public, like given our current legislation, all my documents carry mail and I am okay with that.
6166000	6186000	I used to be very upset with that, but now I'm okay with that because I am taking this within the confines of this system that in a system that casts me into two buckets, I have to reach the most acceptable form unless I explicitly agree at some point to present myself as trans.
6186000	6196000	But in my daily presentation, and again, this is where I have a beef with most of the queer community, which is also why I never gel well with the queer community and I have tried.
6196000	6206000	The majority of them is I do not have the time to work on my presentation because there is a natural way in which things happen and I let that slide.
6206000	6211000	So at which point my presentation comes off as mostly male.
6211000	6219000	But then when I'm conscious, it again, it's on the audience. So I'm kind of that much. I have built, I have templatized this to the point.
6219000	6228000	So what I'm saying is, it's probably important to explain to Ray that within that context, I don't have the time to work on my presentation.
6228000	6238000	Even if you are choosing to represent yourself as a girl, it's important to remember that it is within that context. Do not identify that with your identity.
6238000	6248000	Yes, yes. So the entire part about is that an immutable part of my identity.
6248000	6254000	We always give her enough time to work on my presentation.
6254000	6264000	So the entire part about is that an immutable part of my identity.
6264000	6273000	We always give her enough solid grasp to hold on to that it isn't if you don't want it.
6273000	6283000	I am not going to shape you in any one way or the other. If you want the binary identity to be yours, be my guess.
6283000	6292000	If you don't want to be, that's also fine. I don't care. I wouldn't I wouldn't give you an weapon in either direction or not.
6292000	6306000	If you ask questions, I'll give you the answer. And yeah, so my personal way of understanding this, like at the way I represent myself is that it's more like a HSL scale.
6307000	6314000	It is. It is. It's kind of like HSL, right? Because the L is the thing that is often overlooked.
6314000	6329000	So I knew that you were going for that as well. That's why I've said this, because not only gender, also for sexuality, I think I can have that much that it's not about the exact which value of the color will you're choosing.
6329000	6342000	It matters a whole lot how the saturation and luminosity affects. What if you are red and you have a very high saturation, but the luminosity is zero?
6342000	6350000	The outward expression would be black. You would not be presented as red. You'd be black in that case, right?
6350000	6366000	So that is where I think my identity falls in. I am very much like I'm in love with that androgynous representation of some like I would I you have probably never seen me project myself as like overly manly man or overly feminine.
6366000	6379000	Like man or something, whatever that is, I don't go. It's not that it's like basically I reject the concept of having that as a strong part. That is not the strong part of my identity.
6379000	6391000	I am various other things. And I would choose any where on the spectrum as long as the luminosity is zero. So it doesn't matter whether I'm red or blue or green.
6392000	6400000	Luminosity is zero means I'm black. And that's the part like that's all you need to know. Move on. Let's talk about something else that I find more interesting.
6400000	6409000	And I'm not saying that this is not interesting. I'm just saying that that's where from childhood since childhood, I never really wanted to put so much value into it.
6409000	6414000	So a lot of people complain that didn't bother me.
6417000	6426000	Eventually, I got daddy go. It's probably a little bit less than the point is like it never was a problem for me.
6427000	6436000	My identity was not like I want to go like I don't know. I don't know. That never really bothered me.
6438000	6447000	Or do I need to like present the presentation part? Do I need to do that in order to present myself some other that also didn't bother.
6447000	6458000	So either of the cases that so I am very comfortable and happy with that null kind of in a way. Right. So and I'm fine with this.
6458000	6468000	So any I I don't think anybody needs anybody else's approval for this matter or even like the what do you call that?
6468000	6482000	Yep. And after like 10, 12 years of trying to identify my gender sexuality and having gone through the pretty much all the possible literature that I have access to, I think you were very right.
6482000	6494000	And I think I usually say no to this, but I have to humble up and accept that a lot of my earlier actions in life have been motivated by pleasing others, pleasing or accepting the people immediately around me.
6494000	6503000	And I don't think I can change it. I don't think I can change it, which means my only option is to choose who's around me.
6503000	6514000	Right. So you remember Mossfest or something in London, there was this thing that Larissa had done this.
6514000	6521000	Larissa had done this. I'm not sure if you were in that session. I think it was one of those London sessions.
6521000	6530000	Robin Boo was there to remember. She got people to stand in a line and there was this take a step forward if you agree or backward if you disagree.
6530000	6538000	And there was this question of if you don't identify as a cishet person or something.
6538000	6544000	And I stepped back and there were people like, what, you?
6544000	6550000	Oh, we thought you were this extroverted, very handsome man.
6550000	6560000	The only thing I'm willing to take from that statement is handsome.
6560000	6568000	I'm willing to take. But see, the point is that I'm just trying to tell you that you have not lost much.
6568000	6580000	My entire study into this, trying to really understand things, because it feels like there is something really big happening here in the way that people are expressing their gender, sexuality, the expression.
6580000	6586000	I love pride. I have been into one or two of those marches. I love that.
6586000	6592000	I love the openness that happens within that, knowing that this is that contextual boundary outside.
6592000	6603000	This is not safe. But the thing that I could not take into account was that there is this understanding.
6603000	6614000	And again, this is a criticism of the majority of the people I have come across that you got to show it, that you got to flash it and you got to celebrate it.
6614000	6622000	And I do, because I do. But here is what this process is taking a very small is running on low priority.
6622000	6625000	There is a thread running. Yeah, it is keeping a check.
6625000	6631000	Exactly. I'm very weird. It gets weird to how do I project it.
6631000	6642000	But I 100% agree what you're saying here is that from a priority-wise perspective, there are all the other things that I'm very much more interested about than this.
6642000	6650000	I have no disrespect for it. I understand, but I'd rather put that in the back of my head.
6650000	6660000	Then look at that. I'm just talking. Why does my color schemes when I design something go to red and black?
6660000	6674000	There is a reason. And the reason is this. I want to choose the luminosity level based on the interaction, based on the person, based on the subject at hand or the situation at hand.
6674000	6681000	If I want to show you the colors as they are at that point, all I got to do, boss, is increase the luminosity slider.
6681000	6693000	But first I need to verify that you are worth it or that I am feeling I like dark. I like the lack of light. It helps me think there is there are many, many variations.
6693000	6704000	So if you want to plot the gender on a certain spectrum, also include my willingness to divulge that or to take that as a primary topic.
6704000	6715000	But here I am discussing gender in a way that I typically would bypass. I have learned that I don't need to educate others.
6716000	6726000	I also went through this phase where I was this vocal proponent and something was not right. And what was not right, it felt like being an anchor for Republic TV.
6726000	6741000	I mean, yeah, I am on the news. Yeah, I am shouting. But is this worth the news? I mean, yeah, it appeals to a lot of people. But is this worth the news?
6741000	6751000	So in that sense, the worthiness, remember last session, we had this discussion what is worth doing on that worthiness scale.
6751000	6760000	This is not something to ignore. It is something to prepare and let it stay. It will step in. It is a bounding function.
6760000	6766000	It will step in if that part gets over like somebody forces something out.
6766000	6788000	Yeah, I think one of the good analogies, at least to me, in my mind, it sounds like a good analogy, is that some people need being told over and over, I love you, as in a form of like, hey, to make it hit home and constant reminder of like, hey, you are loved, somebody else loves you, essentially.
6788000	6797000	For them, it is necessary in that way. For me, it doesn't seem necessary. It does not mean that love is not there.
6797000	6809000	Right? It is the same way. Celebration is the exact same way. I don't need to be reminded or remind anyone for that thing to be exactly that same way.
6809000	6827000	It is just that I don't have to celebrate it or put it forward for everybody else. I don't need that. It is inside my head. Whether you approve of it or disapprove of it, it doesn't matter. I couldn't care either way, which was the point I was getting to. I really didn't care what others think.
6827000	6840000	And that, my friend, is the fundamental difference, which is why I said that I better own up to this, because there is no other way of understanding the differences in your and my approach.
6840000	6860000	Yeah, I care very less about what others thought about. And I think the credit goes to my dad, essentially. Because when you are a kid, your worldview is forming as if there is the ideal high state of some kind.
6860000	6870000	Somebody you are trying to idealize. At that point, if that somebody actively breaks it down to you, that idealism is a play you should.
6870000	6884000	In a way, if you want more bandwidth, you start being skeptical. And at the void of all of it, after being skeptical and trying all different ways to question that thing, you still wouldn't break it.
6884000	6893000	That's a pretty good thing. Then it's worth being a fan of. But everything eventually breaks down at some point.
6893000	6900000	The point is, I do make mistakes. That was my dad's thing. I do make mistakes.
6900000	6914000	So when that was like, I want to idealize this person, this person is somebody I can idealize more than anybody else that I can see. But this person is actively going out of their way to prove that they also make mistakes.
6914000	6928000	Then how much others do. And at that point, can I take anybody's any words for granted? Everything is basically nebulous until proven. I'm not gonna, this is not something that I'm committing to.
6929000	6946000	I heard what you were saying. I'll come back to it in three days, maybe. In between, I'll ask around. So in that way, never nobody said to me was immediately committed, I felt good or bad or anything. It didn't really matter.
6946000	6962000	Most of the time it's like, okay, that was yet another stupid thing. For the lack of a better resolution. That is true in most cases, only when you take that as an assumption, that's only when.
6962000	6974000	And for them, probably that's the baseline. I don't mind. But for me, I now know where does that fall down. So in that way, I never cared about that included teacher and everybody else.
6974000	6982000	My point, my problem ended up becoming, am I a pathological, like I am, am I like, what are my personality?
6982000	6983000	The perfect sociopath.
6983000	6998000	Yeah. So how much of a sociopath am I? And the point is, that I cannot discuss with anybody. I had to go on out of my way to find out books and resources about what are the traits of a psychopath? What are the, how?
6998000	7008000	And then what I eventually realized is that, again, if you go by executive functions, there are lots of psychopathic tendency in various different people.
7008000	7030000	What ended up happening, I understood very early in my life, like 12, 13, around that time, is that good faith, as in not trying to act as if you are trying to harm somebody, is one of the best thing that you can do to not become the monster that you don't want to be.
7031000	7042000	And that was pretty much, that was pretty much it. Like once that was the understanding that one of the, one of the baseline like maxim or assumptions that knowingly.
7042000	7051000	So I, my interpretation was, I wouldn't do something that I cannot, with pride, explain to my grandkids.
7051000	7060000	So if I'm doing something, anything, if I cannot take pride in doing that, to explain to my grandkids, because a lot of stupid things I will do.
7060000	7069000	And as long as I'm able to laugh at that end, like at the end part of my life. So this is, this is a stupid, not malicious, right?
7069000	7075000	So even if I do stupid things, that's fine. Malicious, not fine. I shouldn't do that.
7075000	7082000	And that was my cut-off. If I cannot explain that with pride to my grandkids, that's what I don't do.
7082000	7092000	That defined a lot of things that I have or haven't done in my life, but that's what, that's what it boiled down to in my understanding of, the understanding of bona fide, like understanding of good faith.
7092000	7100000	I did not know that by that term or understanding or knowledge. I just understood that sometimes people end up doing things that are way too selfish.
7100000	7108000	And they know that they just would create justification for it, weave justification for it in order to absolve themselves of that.
7108000	7115000	I wanted to know that, hey, I am actively making a mistake here. So that's the part that only helped me.
7116000	7125000	Yeah, I think last 20 years almost has been just like not a lot of other things, just trying to understand myself better and better and better.
7125000	7133000	Yeah, like I said, if I'm five years old, that was the counter, like that was the limit I hit in life.
7133000	7140000	And you know what? This calls for a complete reset. It seems like certain things were working and things broke very badly.
7140000	7150000	And now there is a need for a complete reset because there is this underlying hunch that something I'm not paying attention to.
7150000	7160000	And the something I was not paying attention to was this constant voice that I was suppressing in order to what I thought adapting to the environment.
7161000	7175000	Yeah, anyhow, this was illuminating in many ways and in many sense, this kind of I guess validates what I thought about you.
7175000	7183000	And I just looked at the photo that you shared.
7183000	7192000	Oh, so when you talked about that lollipop trees, that was that was the first watercolors.
7192000	7197000	That one was and I was forced to put more colors.
7197000	7203000	It was very faded. I increased the saturation as well.
7203000	7211000	I was very much I was very much like the saturation was really faded.
7211000	7220000	And also the tent is tent and the trees are lollipops.
7220000	7225000	I posted it a long time back when you were talking about that.
7225000	7232000	I had seen, but then I had seen and parked it. I'll come back to that. But yeah, that is how a brain operates.
7232000	7244000	So see, I don't know how to tie this back because I don't think there is any point in tying this back as much as taking the complexity of everything that we have been talking of.
7244000	7261000	And the only valid summary that I guess you can make of everything that we have discussed is kind of boiling down to the fact that what was it that Shukumar Rai really retained in his writing.
7261000	7268000	It's that childishness, so to say, the ability, the tenacity, the fluidity.
7268000	7277000	And if I am to expand the maxim that has kind of come at this point from that, it's OK to forget.
7277000	7283000	It's never OK to stop thinking or analyzing, but it's terribly important to remember certain things.
7283000	7296000	And at all times, the only principle worth dying for is retaining fluidity, is retaining the ability to change.
7296000	7316000	Pretty much, pretty much this, right? I see you have a dialectic oscillation. I can just get what you can want to say from the headings.
7316000	7324000	Pretty much, yes. I was going for this.
7324000	7328000	Summarize, summarize. That was actually pretty good. Keep, keep going.
7328000	7345000	And so this has kind of boiled down to this one set of principle that how do I understand the concept of liberty, the concept of justice is also through this lens.
7345000	7363000	And if you remember me saying that I hold on to this fact that collective human consciousness or collective human memory is spontaneous, that humanity forgets way more often than we want to think we do.
7363000	7375000	And there is value in that forgetting. That forgetting is just making space for something new to occupy that.
7375000	7384000	For me, the composting of food materials through fungus into soil is a sort of forgetting.
7384000	7404000	Through me, death is a form of forgetting. And simultaneously, the ability to analyze, like when I say analyze, I mean, what is it but observe and understand.
7404000	7428000	And that small, ah, that's what, you know, that ting that goes on. I would like to think it is as primal as, you know, if you ever find yourself in that dark, dark night in a forest where you can't see anything, you don't have a light with you.
7428000	7451000	The first thing that happens is your other senses get stronger. You sense the wind. At that point, it is okay to not see. It's when the next you encounter light, the light feels blinding to the point that you realize that the majority of the universe is dark.
7451000	7477000	And it is not dark because there is no light. It is simply dark because we have so far looked at it through this lens of perceiving photonic particles into our eyes, observing them through these certain lenses, which is why the first time an x-ray imaging was taken, people were like, how is there so many things?
7477000	7494000	And if one thing an astrophysicist will tell you is there are so many different wavelengths to observe the universe in, that was probably, yeah. And there are so many ways we don't know yet.
7494000	7514000	So what is the one thing that we absolutely must ensure that happens, especially if, let's say, I would like to think that the contribution to the human evolution, like at one point I used to be that very strong classic textbook misanthrope.
7514000	7530000	I say, like, I got nothing to do with evolution. But now I kind of realize the evolutionary responsibility in a certain different way. There is, of course, procreate, push your genes forward, carry on the human line.
7530000	7540000	Lucky for me, there are many others doing that. I can choose not to. So again, it's that focus, you know, that it's that trade-off.
7540000	7546000	Yeah, of course. But the only reason that I chose to, like, I understand exactly what you're saying.
7546000	7560000	No, again, I am the one thing I was very glad is that you chose to have a kid because I like here a specimen like me has chosen so experimental conditions available without having to invest.
7560000	7579000	Which I just want to point out, this is the value of a collective upbringing, that the reason why communities, kids who grow up in communities tend to be that much more well-rounded emotionally or empathically,
7579000	7597000	the sharp edges that we have had to smoothen out over our lifetimes that we will continue to and we will never reach the sort of smoothness that let's say your kid is going to go into never having that sharp edge in the first place because it began with that well-roundedness.
7597000	7609000	Right. Is that the evolutionary responsibility is also to carry on this knowledge that change is essential.
7609000	7626000	Yeah. And if you are to sum up that whole maxim that I told about the life, it boils down to this, that change is essential at every point, ensure that change is possible, no matter however written in stone.
7626000	7630000	If anything is written in stone, make sure you have something to break that stone down.
7630000	7642000	Yeah. It's okay to write in stone. It's okay. Why is it okay to write in stone is you want something to last longer, longer than other relatively other things which take relatively lesser time.
7642000	7659000	But as long as we are bound by time, as long as we are bound by this moving towards the entropy state, we are still bound by certain finite conditions and one of them is that you cannot stop change.
7659000	7667000	So why fight it? Which is why the best way it's not about swimming upstream or downstream.
7667000	7680000	It is completely about do you have the fucking boat and then something might happen because of which the stream reverses.
7680000	7700000	Can you respond to that change? If you were very strongly going upstream, upstream, upstream, the moon starts rotating the other way around, the earth starts spinning the other way around, gravity flips, another earth comes on top of the earth and suddenly your stream goes upstream.
7700000	7714000	The point is this, why is it okay to forget? It's okay to forget because the only way to allow change within a finite state machine that is our brain is to free up circuits for change.
7714000	7721000	The reason it is not okay to stop thinking and analyzing is because situations may change.
7721000	7730000	You cannot take something that was true or known to be true earlier if you face that again you've got to re-evaluate even if you come to the same answer.
7730000	7738000	You keep on re-evaluating, might not be looking at it fine enough that you spot the finer decimal points.
7738000	7756000	Why is it absolutely critical to remember certain things? It's absolutely necessary to remember how did you bring about change the last time you encountered something like this.
7756000	7768000	Which again boils down to the final part that fluidity. So if you then take this, apply it to gender, it means that fluidity is of paramount importance.
7768000	7781000	You apply it to justice, it means the ability to reinterpret and reinterpret that fast enough so that by then the situations have not changed under which things had come in.
7781000	7787000	That a process of justice that takes too long is an outdated process.
7787000	7794000	Exactly the challenge with the justice system is right now. The world moves too fast for it to be caught up.
7794000	7805000	But that does not mean that you compromise on your variables and arrive at a simpler form of justice. It does not mean that justice has to be handed out right then.
7805000	7813000	What I'm saying is increase your computation power, increase the ability to parallely process multiple things.
7813000	7831000	And it is this ability to parallel process that again ties back to why brains like mine or probably yours and many other people like us tend to ignore the finer details of life in favor of acquiring, observing the complexity.
7831000	7843000	The only way to observe the complexity is to distance yourself to be able to broaden your field of vision or rather to get more things into your field of vision.
7843000	7849000	Yeah, I think that's the only way that I can sum up what we got.
7849000	7865000	Yeah, so that's fantastic by the way. The one only reason I was bringing out that document is because part of it about what we are saying that what the childishness, the neoteny.
7865000	7874000	Yeah, one, the antithesis of the will to power is will to play.
7874000	7885000	I was showing in that section is that how will to power, will to power and will to play are not so.
7885000	7894000	Shukumar Rai is basically celebrating that will to play in a very rough sense.
7894000	7904000	My point was they are not, they basically access like where those are two different extremes.
7904000	7920000	But actually they live on a balance. Both need to be there. The will to power and the will to play. Both need to be there because what is will to power is the exercise to play.
7920000	7931000	So exercise of power is the will to play. If you want to play that means what? You are capable of and allowed to play.
7931000	7941000	So similarly what is will to power? The intent to play. Why would you want to act like am as power?
7941000	7955000	Is that you want to see some certain thing to happen that is your play and because you see the threat in it like I am not allowed to do that, how do I ensure that I am allowed to play?
7955000	7977000	Is that how you go on about it, the will to power? So anyways that is the part I was trying to show is that the relationship between those two things, the necessity for one or the other even though at its core, at my core I am very much of a will to power kind of person like at a pathological level.
7977000	8000000	The exposure to Sukumar Rai opened me up to seeing that other side where the will to play is necessary. It is not one dimensional. The dimensionality of it, the spectrum, I need to see that and I need to position myself well enough not to become an extremist of either of the sides.
8000000	8029000	Because that is what ends up happening. All the dictatorship, all the authoritative approaches to life as well as to state, to company, to governing anything basically boils down to people seeing it in a very one dimensional way and not having enough understanding of the will to play part.
8029000	8044000	So I think for anybody in a leadership role they should be exposed to this will to play in their own languages but to meet Sukumar Rai helped in that sense. That is the part that I was trying to bring back up.
8044000	8055000	So it had other parts as well, the oscillation part of things. I wanted to discuss that but I think we are too late for this. Let us push it back to the next week.
8055000	8057000	I do not mind.
8057000	8063000	No, it is okay. I do not want to associate this discussion with a sense of exhaustion.
8063000	8068000	I think I am like five hours away from exhaustion.
8068000	8078000	That is okay. Let us break it off here and let us look forward to the next one.
8078000	8100000	So the next one is where I would want to talk about the concept of thesis-antithesis synthesis and how it is missing one parameter, the hypothesis and why that is necessary.
8100000	8118000	Why it is somewhat incomplete without and why having it is actually really really more complete from a scientific or technological perspective. That is the analogy that I am going to bring it down to essentially.
8118000	8125000	So let us look at it next week.
8125000	8132000	So that is it for this week. Let us catch back up next week. I am going to stop this.
