00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm trying to go live.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
Before you go, do you have any specific topic in mind?

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll leave the OBS behind.

00:46.000 --> 01:02.000
Assuming everything else is happening fine and the audio levels are fine, let's start with an introduction which is going to be awkward anyway.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello and welcome everyone.

01:04.000 --> 01:19.000
We are continuing forward from our last session, which was the introduction, so hopefully this time we'll have a little bit nicer grip on the topic or discussion and the flow of it.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
With that said, I have roughly 3 topics.

01:25.000 --> 01:35.000
The first one is that, remember we were talking about how do we demystify the concepts that are inherently nebulous, things like philosophy.

01:35.000 --> 01:48.000
How do we make it more scientific or to preach to people that want to understand things in a logical, rational, measurable or quantifiable manner.

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
I can give a couple of examples of that kind of approach working, so I'll run that through.

01:58.000 --> 02:08.000
The second one is that tomorrow is actually the 100th anniversary of Sukumar Ray's death.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
He is a huge impact in my life, so I've been thinking of paying some kind of homage.

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
I don't know exactly in what way, what is appropriate and what I'm capable of, but in some way at least I'm trying to remember him.

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
The third one is kind of chalking out the lay of the land of metaphysics.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
In a sense, what are the things that are worth covering that needs a modern reinterpretation or that we can kind of talk about or reflect on?

02:45.000 --> 02:55.000
And what are the things, especially trying to find out, I am very concerned, what if there are things like blind spots that I have absolutely no clue about not knowing, essentially.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
So what are the things I need to upgrade myself about as well?

02:58.000 --> 03:10.000
So that is basically like putting each other on each other's blind spot and finding out what are the things that we both need to build up, so that then we can start filling up the details.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
It's like a jigsaw puzzle, but the pieces are old.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
We need to create new pieces that are not different, but the reinterpretation that fits better right now, essentially.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Something that we can distilled version, the PO version that we can also consolidate.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
So those are the three topics that I think.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
How do you think?

03:36.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, I think I would have switched the order and put Shukumaraya first and then progressively from there, because I feel like that itself is like the seed to begin with.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
It is, in a meta sense, it is.

03:55.000 --> 04:10.000
The very reason that I will speak in a selfish way, because I don't know many people who have walked a similar kind of pathway.

04:10.000 --> 04:30.000
So in that sense, growing up in an environment that is kind of academic, but have seen or perceived the necessity to become a careerist, but then again understood the necessity of the concept of absurdism, like the surrealism.

04:30.000 --> 04:47.000
Like why, at which point that rampant rationalism falls apart and you need that support of the fun in life without which you can't proceed, like life becomes very bleak.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You cannot rationalize that part.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
Sometimes no matter how well you do things, you still lose, at which point all you can do is laugh at it.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
And like I'm probably not putting it the right way, but I've seen that thing and it was always challenging.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
I've seen people at various order, like various spectrum, but not most of the time.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
I didn't see many people who covered the whole spectrum, whole of it.

05:11.000 --> 05:23.000
So it was always challenging for me to communicate with people on the entire spectrum who understand the rational world as well as Viralaya Talibhusha.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
So that part is where I come along.

05:27.000 --> 05:38.000
So not only the challenge that I have is exactly that you are seeing is that I cannot put that into words partially because I have no practice of it.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
I haven't spoken to people with whom I can talk about it because there was no option for that.

05:45.000 --> 05:57.000
Now I am going to hand it over to you and take that forward, like whatever I didn't or I failed to say, what are the parts that you can cover on this particular topic?

05:57.000 --> 06:13.000
So I think if you start with the absurdist literature in its truest form, let's say, well, truest in the sense like let's take a narrow track here, Shukumarai specifically.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
That the absurdism when I grew up, like growing up, one of the first things I read in life was Hoja Borala.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
And I think I'm forever grateful because the next thing I read in like the first Bangla I had read was Hoja Borala.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
The first English I had read was Alice in Wonderland.

06:30.000 --> 06:45.000
And I think that the combined impact of that made me feel like while these were told to me as children's stories,

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
I did think it is children's stories because I understood it. I felt like I understood that it resonated with me.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
Like the Cheelo Rumal Hoye Galo Beral. It can happen. That's what it's about.

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
But then probably I remember the first time I came across the concept of a pun was Sri Baikarun Singh.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Like B.A. Baikarun Singh. B.A. because I am Bae.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
But what I'm trying to say here is, yes, I do Bae.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
I was like, okay, there's something here. But there was an interesting thing that happened to me at that point in life.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
And again, I think we need to narrate very subjective experiences here and then see where the intersections are.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
And one of them was I had this neighbor who insisted that I learn translation, who insisted with my parents,

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
that seems like your kid is able to grasp a language, which is ironic that I did not speak till the age of like two and a half.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
I was a late bloomer in that sense. And I'm still a late bloomer in pretty much everything in life.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
But in that sense, as in the primary language, your language. Yeah, like I could not.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
I did not have vocal skills to the point that and even when I spoke, I stammered a lot.

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
Like I stammered a lot till like 17, 18. But what the translation gave me was I had Alice in Wonderland.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
I had Alice in Wonderland on the other hand, and I had Hojo Borala on the other.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
And then in true Robi Thakur fashion, I was given Hamlet to translate into Bangla.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay, I think I was five years old then. That did not catch my attention.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
But I went back to Hojo Borala reading that. And I remember feeling this thing that I mean, I didn't understand what Hamlet was like first two pages in.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
I was like, this is definitely not children's story. But this Hojo Borala is children's story.

08:49.000 --> 08:57.000
I remember reading it back again around the age of eight, nine.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Feeling that, okay, I understand something more now. I had spoken the language for a few more years.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Then there was a long gap. I read it back again when I was 16.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
And I thought, okay, because it was that old, dusted, heartbound book that I open and read and like, hang on.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
This does not feel like children's story anymore.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
This fellow trying to go like telling the road to Thibaut.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
What was it?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Kolkata Ranaghat? Diamond Harbor, Thibaut?

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Diamond Harbor, Thibaut.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
So I had some sort of understanding of geography and the way it was going.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
So what happened? The click that happened, there was why.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
Because there had been the school, 10 years of schooling that had pushed into me that rationality.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Maths, the way it was taught, had taught me logic.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
And then I was like, this is the framework and scientific methodology.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
All combined together made it feel like an obscure way of looking at things.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
But then the why quickly became why not?

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
And that is also what connects to Zoidberg.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
So I realized that there is something happening here.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And the main thing is, it was no longer a children's story to me,

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
but there was a certain comfort in that absurdity that when all else fails,

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
and age of 16 was one of the most disastrous periods of my life, academically, family, everything together.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And it was a situation in which all else had failed.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
And the answer to what else was why not take the long route to Thibaut?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And kind of I hang on to it.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Okay, the main thing is what? I need to go to Thibaut.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm currently in Ranaghat.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I might as well go to Diamond Heart, but then go to Thibaut.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Whether I find Kesavadada or not.

11:04.000 --> 11:16.000
And that, the power of that absurdism there took me, I think, I probably reread, I have never reread Haujaborala.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
And I read it back to back a few times.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
And each time it felt like there were layers upon layers upon layers of what was happening.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
That this was not just, I mean, it's like you come to this absurdism with just for the humor.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We'll get just the humor.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
You come to it to defy logic, you will get the defying logic.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Come to it for fun, you get that.

11:41.000 --> 11:53.000
But most of all, to me, it was like when all else fails, what is that framework that will allow me to still make sense of what was happening around me?

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
In many ways, this is a form of dissociation, like absurdism is a form of dissociation from reality.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
And the power of the dissociation is you have disconnected from the finite rules that you were bound by.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
And for me, it was also psychological manifestation happening at the same point.

12:13.000 --> 12:23.000
And that kind of brought me, and the only way I want to sum that up is, then I went back to Abul Dabul.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
And the last poem hit me.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
That one, that one slaps.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And since then, yeah, it is.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And by then I knew of the story, by then I knew of the history of what had happened.

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
And then it hit me that that same mind is saying this is practically on his deathbed.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, that's what is like.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
That's when you actually get the hits you in a way.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Hang on a moment.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
In the other parts where same or similar tone or like the frequency have hit me,

13:05.000 --> 13:14.000
this guy was not basically laughing from his cheek to cheek or ear to ear, whatever the notion is.

13:14.000 --> 13:25.000
But he was trying to make something that is very grim or very bleak and laying it out in front of you at the hope of...

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
So here's the thing. Nonsense is basically when nothing makes sense, how do you make sense of it?

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
You were saying that at the end of everything else stops making sense.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
How do you still reconcile? How do you still keep on going?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
That's where that nonsense strikes.

13:43.000 --> 13:51.000
That's where it tries to, even if null is a data type here.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
So I will expand on the null part.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
So that's how that's when it actually happened, occurred to me.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
Like, hang on, not only there's more to it, that part is the more essential part.

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
And the rest of it is basically an act like passing it along as a children's story or children's book or children's poem,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
all those things so that he can publish it in Saunders.

14:17.000 --> 14:24.000
But it is so much more for the parent of that child as well as for that child.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
For me, I was...

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
See, it's not 8 years and 3 months or something.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
How old are you? 8 years and 3 months?

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
I was 8 years and 3 months when first time reading it.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
It was weirdly, almost somebody sent a time capsule knowing that,

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
hey, this guy, I need to hit him where it properly...

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
This particular, what do you call that thing? People pinch needles, right?

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
The Chinese acupuncture?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah, acupuncture.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
So it's almost like we need to acupuncture this guy at the exact right spot.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
So we should hand this book over to this guy and make him read this part when he's 8 years and 3 months old.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And read this part and then it hits him.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
If I did not read those kinds of things, there's some very curious stuff that happens, right?

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
And at that point, is this meant to happen? Is this some kind of destiny?

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Should I be more concerned, more careful, more focused about exactly what I am...

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I kind of felt gratitude after that point onward.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Like, hey, most people at my time, at my age is not doing this.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
They're missing out.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Don't want to look at it in a very different way.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I should be thankful that I can enjoy this.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Nothing else. I can read this. I find this funny.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I find this enjoyable.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I don't need a big meaning or anything else at this point.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
And I just want to find it interesting and entertaining enough and more like it, essentially.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
That probably created the bandwidth for which now then I can enjoy Python as comedy.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Same or similar, I would say, in a sense, right?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
We start with something, we end with something.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Neither of those things make sense.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
But overall, it's a social commentary that is objectively funny.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
And you can project it any different ways you want.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
All of those ways would be funny.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
And neither of those would be objected by the author themselves.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
That was how I was seeing it.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I was really bad at...

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah, go ahead.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Sorry, I just wanted to tie back the thing you said about null, right?

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
So nonsense, then the interpretation of it became not as not sensical.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It became beyond sense.

16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
And however, the question that comes up, then what is the sense that we are talking of in this context?

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Is it sensory perception beyond the limits of sensory perception?

17:07.000 --> 17:21.000
Is it sense as, going back to our maxims, as commonly accepted social principles as the sense that anything that is beyond those commonly accepted social practices,

17:21.000 --> 17:38.000
or is it that the sense here is in a way that anything that has meaning and a forceful breaking down, deconstruction of that meaning,

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
so again, in that sense, beyond sense, that what lies beyond sense,

17:44.000 --> 17:59.000
so if I throw language beyond the boundary of common usage, if I try to use language beyond the boundaries of perception, of rationality, of societal understanding, of accepted knowledge,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
what does language become?

18:02.000 --> 18:16.000
And that is where I think the fluidity, you know, that playing with the language comes in, because you have then abstracted the concept of the ability to express anything based on certain parallels.

18:16.000 --> 18:30.000
So in that sense, that way of application of language is very similar to how generative AI works, that it's just predicting.

18:30.000 --> 18:41.000
It's just taking a set of items, converting that into a series of other data type that you just can't understand, and then patch that back.

18:41.000 --> 18:50.000
And so I just want to say that what that said, and I think at that, that was also the point I was learning programming seriously in life.

18:50.000 --> 19:04.000
And I realized the importance of null. And I realized how much of a pain the null pointer exceptions were, how much was the undefined behavior that acted,

19:04.000 --> 19:21.000
but in all, I think it has still stayed that I still look at null as this concept of a nonsense, like a beyond sense, beyond definition, and nothing really cemented that concept in me as strong as Shukumar guy's writing has.

19:21.000 --> 19:41.000
Because in a sense, null is a conscious choice. It's not that something failed. Null is a conscious choice of the developer to keep it that way from everything else, like undefined can be different thing.

19:41.000 --> 19:53.000
Zero can be different. When it's null, that means the developer shows it to be null. It doesn't happen like out of the blue.

19:53.000 --> 20:05.000
I think one of the ways to put it would be think of a jigsaw puzzle, like lots of pieces, right? The puzzle that hasn't been solved yet, a new thing.

20:05.000 --> 20:17.000
When you're pushing the boundary, a new layer of the land, you haven't mapped it out yet. So you have a jigsaw puzzle where there are pieces, nobody knows what the correct order is.

20:17.000 --> 20:38.000
Now, there's a playful entity going ahead and creating Bokochop or Hansjaru out of that, because nobody knows what the right answer is. The sense has not been laid out yet.

20:38.000 --> 20:50.000
Out of all those Bokochops and Hansjarus, there would be eventually discovery would be made. Hey, this is the one that is a solved puzzle.

20:50.000 --> 20:59.000
This is the one that is out of all those random trials and errors to some of them are funny, some of them are not funny.

20:59.000 --> 21:09.000
This is the one that is for these people who only want the sensical stuff. They would take that and they will run with it.

21:09.000 --> 21:17.000
That would be the part when this part is understood, at which point people like Sukumar Rai would not find that domain funny anymore.

21:17.000 --> 21:27.000
They would want to push further down the line, because that part of the map is now known map. Now it has been chalked out or mapped out.

21:27.000 --> 21:49.000
I saw that anything from a social norm, cultural weirdness to everything else, I forgot the particular story where he goes to Hindukusha Parvatmala finding weird kind of animals and stuff.

21:49.000 --> 22:00.000
It critics or criticizes the people like the Western explorers going to Africa and their accounts and how they know it.

22:00.000 --> 22:13.000
It is telling a story. It is being funny as well as at the same time it is showing that how absurd does it seem to everybody else if it falls to a normal person's hand.

22:13.000 --> 22:24.000
What does it look like or sound like to them? You cannot say this author's writing is good and this author's writing is BS.

22:24.000 --> 22:34.000
How do you distinguish, how do you quantify that? You don't know that. At that point both of them are true, both of them are right.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
You are just assembling the puzzle pieces in different ways.

22:39.000 --> 22:49.000
So that is how another way to see the nonsense that I have seen is that not only always it is null, it can also be how many ways can I break the game.

22:49.000 --> 23:01.000
And by doing that, finding out this one way the game is not broken, this is the way it is the actual interpretation. Luckily sometimes you end up finding it.

23:01.000 --> 23:19.000
Which is where the success of and the departure of nonsense, when that happens for any particular small domain or subset of case, that's when nonsense exits that, no longer my territory.

23:19.000 --> 23:33.000
Since I have been found here, now I need to push the boundary through. Anyways, I think, so I have been, so do you have anything else? Otherwise I was going to talk about.

23:33.000 --> 23:45.000
So I posted one thing in chat, did you see that? Channel called A-Bong. You are muted, so I cannot hear what you are saying.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
I thought that was a link for this stream.

23:49.000 --> 24:02.000
No, no, no, no, no. So I was trying to go, like start the stream, but it was asking me for, because it's a new channel, it was asking for authentication and enabling streaming, etc., etc., all those things.

24:02.000 --> 24:18.000
So I had to go back to the other channel where you already streamed there. It's being streamed there. For the time being, I know that we probably can do a better job at exactly consolidating all those things, but I think it's still possible.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
But is this the URL where it is, like the channel in which this is streaming now?

24:22.000 --> 24:38.000
No, no, no. I cannot. YouTube won't allow me without like, you have to give the mobile phone number, it takes 24 hours to set up, all those things I was not sure. It was not there before. They started it new.

24:38.000 --> 24:54.000
So I started, like I tried to stream there, and it said that no can do today. So you said that it would be better if we record, so at least the new, like the stream is being recorded, so that's that.

24:54.000 --> 25:11.000
But that channel would be the one where I'm thinking of publishing, starting with Abol Tabol, like the abriti. So I'm doing something, I'm doing something, so that seemed like the lowest hanging fruit.

25:11.000 --> 25:31.000
Going forward, we'll keep on adding more stuff. It's not really only Sukumar Rai or anything. The idea is Bengali literature has not found as much online exposure in this kind of media.

25:31.000 --> 25:52.000
Or maybe I just want to see how much exposure, whether this kind of exposure actually works. I don't want that for kids part. I don't want to make it for kids. I want to make it for adults, for people like the post teenage and then some.

25:52.000 --> 26:12.000
So the people who are trying to now rediscover themselves, for them to grab onto content that are not only somebody else's language content, but their own language content, which it has a rich history. Why not use that?

26:12.000 --> 26:34.000
So that way, but along with that, so all those, all those things will be like Ebong Satyajit, Ebong Sukumar, Ebong Robi Thakur, Ebong Adda. So I was thinking of like, if we can make this or this thing more generic, general purpose, and just post it as like Ebong Adda, or maybe we can use a different branding.

26:34.000 --> 26:51.000
Ebong Adda sounds right to me, like as in okay to me. It's like a huge spectrum, like it can go anywhere pretty much. We are open to discuss pretty much anything. So and then maybe have guest, maybe not have guest, maybe we just go on about it, whatever we want to discuss anyway.

26:51.000 --> 27:11.000
And have that as a repository for that, that we can round back to, that is as a live stream. Sounds good? Yep. Any changes that you'd want to make as in as a conceptual, concept wise?

27:11.000 --> 27:40.000
Not really. But something that occurred to me, just to like bring up in this context, right, that we are talking of Satyajit Rai in the context of that Chhoto Dergol for children's literature. And the one thing I have always felt, and I guess a lot of people feel, but then forget as they grow old, is this contempt for grownups, that why does there need to be a separate children's edition, which is jingly, colourful.

27:40.000 --> 28:09.000
And then should get as grim as you grow older. I was the kid who liked less colours, brighter colours bothered me. So I was like, am I already a grownup? Because I like those grim themed things. But the one thing about Shukumarai's work, and in that sense, I guess it's also shaped how I see, you know, the human consciousness in that sense is the child stage is just a vastly,

28:10.000 --> 28:37.000
fast learning version of the same self. It's almost like the rate of learning peaks and then slowly grades down. And there are psychological analysis to back that up. But I'm seeing the literature or the even the, you know, the way you deal with children, one of my gripe always has been how people do bababacha to kids.

28:37.000 --> 29:00.000
And I never do that. To me, that's an individual to me, or whether part of a collective or not, but that person deserves a certain amount of respect, because who am I to suddenly think that I know better than this person that I have certain new, I know everything that this mind can think of and most of the time it turns out not.

29:00.000 --> 29:25.000
Because again, a young mind is more capable of thinking in nonsensical terms, because it has got lesser amount of sense to unlearn to get there. So the ability for an author or to for somebody to, you know, maintain that level, I mean, yeah, I understand that there are certain things that can be hazardous that, okay, somebody has not learned something.

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
That would you go and give warp technology to somebody who's just invented metals?

29:38.000 --> 29:49.000
And the answer is, yes, you can. But the probability of mishaps go like proportionately higher.

29:49.000 --> 30:06.000
Yeah, but then there is that same infantilizing in our narrative of history, especially of anthropology, when we look back at the Bronze Age, at least the way we would, at least the way I was taught in school, it was as if they were infantile humans.

30:06.000 --> 30:17.000
And slowly we became adolescent humans. Now we are grown up humans. So if I was born at that age, I would have considered right now. Yeah, the best.

30:17.000 --> 30:28.000
We are the best. We are the best. We are done. We are done developing. We're done growing up. Right. That is the part that gets me and it makes me really mad. Like, I am with you so far.

30:28.000 --> 30:53.000
Right. So, okay, we were very underdeveloped and all these things. But to consider that now we got this and now there is no part. That is the part where to ground back to your point, what you are saying is that the crystallization of self or identity or even the concept of reality itself, the crystallization is what growing up traditionally has been.

30:53.000 --> 31:16.000
Growing up is nothing else than the crystallization to lack the fluidity. So the reason we are a little bit mad about the whole thing is because we have retained that neoteny of flexibility, that fluidity among ourselves, within ourselves.

31:16.000 --> 31:29.000
And we prefer to keep it that way, which is why it was not beaten out of us in the right amount of time. We kind of have been able to retain that during that period.

31:29.000 --> 31:45.000
So, which is why now we have more stronger will to continue that because we can see the benefit of it. Think of the, like, the alternative timeline where it has been during the school age has been beaten out of us.

31:45.000 --> 31:55.000
And we don't even know what you are missing out that neoteny. Our identity is strong and we're like, no, this is the best we can ever be. There is nothing else to learn.

31:55.000 --> 32:06.000
Everyone else who says anything else about what doesn't match with our understanding, they're just plain wrong and they should be put in jail or something like that.

32:06.000 --> 32:20.000
Anyways, point here is that's exactly what death of childhood is. To me, childhood is not just one individual identity that should be respected.

32:20.000 --> 32:37.000
The concept of childhood itself should be respected the same way and retained as much as possible because once you lose that, you fail to see what you what you're missing out.

32:37.000 --> 32:48.000
So I'll give it back to you for the part that you are saying that why you think that children's books, the separation of that, you're not okay with that. Please continue on that part.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
I don't think you finished that part.

32:52.000 --> 33:16.000
I mean, I had finished that. But the point, the thing I was talking, trying to point out is this concept of linear evolution and the concept of linear evolution being applied to human history, being applied to education, being applied to the growth of an individual within a society, being applied to a carrier progression everywhere.

33:16.000 --> 33:27.000
It's that linear time is easier to understand. It's easier to understand key in the past we were conquered and now we are free.

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
Like, yeah, in the past, we were conquered by various invasive forces who right now we are free.

33:35.000 --> 34:01.000
Well, but then on the other hand, the specific part about children's literature that really bothers me is it assumes a certain level, a certain step after step of learning that as if somebody is going to learn these concepts about even let's say, what is a biological sex?

34:01.000 --> 34:17.000
What is gender? What? How do you actually reproduce to how do you then build a society? How does this like who's to say in what order somebody is able to understand that?

34:17.000 --> 34:37.000
And for example, as a child growing up, I found that I understood maths faster than I understood literature. But I was not allowed access to higher order mathematics, which means that in class four, I was solving the maths books of my cousins who were in class 10.

34:37.000 --> 34:47.000
And they thought I was showing off. At the same time, I could not give a literary analysis.

34:47.000 --> 35:12.000
What are the most stupidest questions? Like, I was not good at bullshitting. So I was I was good at those kind of questions. Like, yeah, bring bring that. Do you know the right answer? Like, has the did the author talk? If they haven't spoken anything about this? So whatever I say, you cannot say no.

35:13.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah, I mean, what I'm trying to say is that see, a lot of push in educational reform today is also around bringing a more inclusive education to the current generation. And I'm talking of outside the mainstream education.

35:35.000 --> 35:56.000
And my partner works in that a bunch of people I know work in that area. And one of the common themes I keep on hearing is empower the learner. Let the learner create their own curriculum, where the educator is simply the safeguard, as well as the facilitator, the safeguard for the boundary.

35:56.000 --> 36:22.000
So basically, the very strong prime directive in the Star Trek prime directive in the form of non interference needs to apply for the healthy growth of an individual. And from that part, what I want to say is that anything that I think we say, the issue with censorship is that it, again, I'm probably starting to sound like Zizek at this point.

36:22.000 --> 36:35.000
But yeah, praise be Zizek. What I'm trying to say is that the censorship really is this higher moral ground of this holier than thou attitude that I know what is better for you in exactly this order.

36:35.000 --> 36:58.000
Till you cross that threshold, you are not allowed to experiment with this. But suddenly after that, you must. Like suddenly after the age of 18, you must vote in one day, you need to understand what is politics, who is the right candidate to choose. You're not allowed to drive till 16 or 18, depending on where you are.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
17 years, 360 days.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Yes.

37:04.000 --> 37:28.000
And that's like, what this cuts across is in my work, I do not distinguish based on the age. I always distinguish based on, it's like the prerequisites can be almost said in form of a software dependency. Do you have this, this, this and this? That is what you need in order to run this because that's sort of the library I'm drawing from.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
Unless you know that, you won't be able to understand, which is again a knowledge graph.

37:34.000 --> 37:53.000
This is one of the most important or interesting topics to me. There are only a handful of few topics that I am very much invested, I want to do something about it to the point, there are things that I know that this is important, somebody should do something about.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
This is one of the topics like the education system, like reformation of education system.

37:59.000 --> 38:12.000
I don't know, I don't have all the answers, but I know enough of those things that seem absurd, and there needs to be like, there are easier solutions there than the ones that are being employed.

38:12.000 --> 38:27.000
I know that part, and what I am pining for essentially is people with similar kind of mentality, and there's another challenge there is that handling a child is an ethical concern.

38:27.000 --> 38:36.000
Whose child are you giving those values and how they are turning out to be, it basically becomes your responsibility.

38:36.000 --> 38:52.000
And even though you are very sure that what you are doing is a bona fide, like your good faith basis you are doing, trying to do the right thing or best thing that you think you can do, but truth is a shared understanding.

38:52.000 --> 38:59.000
If everybody says that's wrong, then you're wrong, you will be tried for malpractice.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
So how do we change that layer of the land?

39:02.000 --> 39:31.000
So before we get to actually like giving curriculum to kids or facilitating that, a lot of groundwork needs to happen to make that a norm, like this alternative mechanism as a norm, and some bold parents to actually stand up and to do that, like to contribute to that and show that as like, hey, see, this is the results that we are getting out of these practices.

39:31.000 --> 39:44.000
Which will take another generation or something in order to start, like best case scenario, but it has to start there, it has to start somewhere.

39:44.000 --> 40:03.000
I just don't know how exactly, like, there's a reason I probably should not slack off on like meeting Sharon, like speaking to her about these topics. I think I should prioritize that.

40:03.000 --> 40:30.000
In fact, she's gone to Bangalore for a related, she's doing a course which is in related educational field, and this is like a field study trip. But the one thing I just want to point out here, see, the good news is that a lot of work has happened already, and there is substantial ground for this to be considered a viable alternate.

40:30.000 --> 40:50.000
I mean, even if you want to demean that and call it alternative, what I mean by demeaning is it's like saying that the mainstream is still the truth, and these are all truths. But there is a fundamental difference, and I see a very strong, very strong parallel in software engineering to it.

40:50.000 --> 41:10.000
And I keep on drawing this line. So again, if any of them seem too far-fetched, feel free to stop me. There's a big focus of this kind of education system where you are empowering the learner. One is you don't necessarily, your only criteria rather is not the learner's age.

41:10.000 --> 41:25.000
Your criteria is the learner's abilities and lack of abilities. Based on that, a lot of effort, the education is geared towards helping the learner build the curriculum, a sort of service discovery.

41:25.000 --> 41:42.000
That in the software design paradigms, do you design services which explicitly know each other, or do you build a system that acts as service discovery? And then you plug in the different services, let the services discover each other based on the common thing.

41:42.000 --> 42:02.000
So they're doing something very similar in education, that they are putting a lot of effort into helping the child learn, let curiosity lead the way, being one of the foundational principles with the facilitator guiding across. And again, I am not the expert here. I am giving you an external perspective into what I have observed.

42:02.000 --> 42:18.000
But what this boils down to is the fact that you are not starting with a fixed curriculum. You have a certain set of milestones you would like to achieve, and the progression of everyone would not be the same.

42:18.000 --> 42:43.000
So then a standard evaluation technique does not apply anymore. Your evaluation grows more towards a research oriented, so then kids don't give exams, kids write research papers, they choose a topic, they want to build something. You fix some aspects, you know, just like in service definition, you fix that, okay, this is the service discovery URL, this is the protocol it speaks, that part needs to be fixed.

42:43.000 --> 43:04.000
So there is a lot of protocol design work that is happening in this sector right now. And a lot of new organizations are coming up. In fact, specifically, if you've heard of Teach for India, the one thing I know through Sharon, the founders of Teach for India have started something called the Circle Incubation, the Circle India something.

43:04.000 --> 43:21.000
And what they are doing is acting as an incubator in the very way that we are familiar with in the startup world of incubating, you know, startups, except they're incubating educators of the next generation. They're incubating people who are building alternate education principles.

43:21.000 --> 43:46.000
And this is happening in India. And the beauty is that there is a lot more scope within India to do this because of the variety, because of the diversity, because you can't just speak one language, you can't enforce one framework, but you have to build the discovery oriented learning and a research oriented evaluation into things, which is again not new.

43:46.000 --> 44:01.000
You know, in our academic curriculum, we reach that only in like masters or postgrad or in PhD. But suddenly, I mean, I was made to believe that a PhD is this very difficult thing because you have to research.

44:01.000 --> 44:15.000
You don't get a textbook that you mug up and go and write. You have to find what you want to learn, then you have to try to find how you can learn, then you have to learn that and prove that you have learned it. Everything is on you.

44:15.000 --> 44:38.000
So, you know, it's not that these things did not exist. But the point is we break the age barrier, break the learner's basic, like the role of the teacher changes to being that Adi Guru version to like if there was such an Adi Guru, then that Adi Guru would be an encyclopedia.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
That would also guide you.

44:41.000 --> 45:05.000
And finally, the one tragedy, the other tragedy that I find very curious, I've been rewatching, rather I've been watching the original Star Trek, you know, greeting through the sexist metaphors, the racial metaphors that exist, but trying to look at what was being done, trying to look at it in the context of 1962 through 67 or 69, what it was.

45:05.000 --> 45:18.000
That what was really going on that it has to be compared at par with what was and the new things that it says, and something still fall in place, which you see TNG kind of trying to rectify.

45:18.000 --> 45:27.000
One of those things, I mean, prime directive is probably mentioned somewhere in season two, late in season two, till then it was called the non-interference directive.

45:27.000 --> 45:41.000
And the directive is the prime directive is simply that a higher order civilization should not influence or contaminate development of a lower order civilization.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
And the non-interference to be practiced as the prime goal.

45:47.000 --> 46:04.000
And I think that prime directive applies very strongly to education, to the way we run our political systems, to the way we run our any like even at a family level, you know, that where does that leave you?

46:04.000 --> 46:17.000
Because the prime directive also has scopes where you would override it, where you see constantly Jean-Luc Picard throws prime directive to the air every now and then that they are overriding their judgment.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
So that is kind of a facilitator stepping in and saying that, okay, you might have said non-interference, but this is not safe.

46:24.000 --> 46:47.000
There is also a judgment call, but just tying that together, the education aspect of things also need to be treated from the perspective of a discovery and the ability to explore what is beyond the sensical world that the learner knows already, because what else are you exposing them to otherwise?

46:47.000 --> 47:03.000
But I think what's interesting too, what I don't have is an experiment in progress, which you have, like that you said, the bringing up a child as the ethical dilemma that at which point do you throw that in? What do you balance? And I think that's another perspective that I'm interested in.

47:03.000 --> 47:17.000
So that's another topic I was not thinking that we can discuss today, but I'm happy to discuss that. So I actually had a couple of hypothesis in my mind.

47:17.000 --> 47:32.000
One of the things that you said that you learn to speak later in your life as in like two and a half, two, two and a half. So what I found is that, okay, this discussion is a bit longer or like a larger context. Let me establish the context, right?

47:32.000 --> 47:54.000
So I was never convinced that intellect is the like from Alpha to Omega of what people's capabilities are. There needs to be, there is, there are more things to it than what IQ measures.

47:54.000 --> 48:21.000
What are those things? Is there a comprehensive, like, like, can you map it out? Can you chalk it out? What are those things that one mind can handle? You are employing your neurons to do, and sometimes your neurons can decide, I am not good at this, or rather, I don't want to be good at this. I want to be good at this other thing.

48:21.000 --> 48:36.000
Right? So it always struck me as a choice. And I have seen that most of the time, people would choose some or the other at the cost of some other things.

48:36.000 --> 48:58.000
People who are really good at reasoning, problem solving, like the visual, like, or ordering of stuff, those are the traditional IQs. They would also have, most of the time, they would not have too many other things, but sometimes they would be good linguists as well.

48:58.000 --> 49:14.000
If they are good linguists as well as good, like, higher IQ, they might even be in an autistic spectrum where they have really poor social interactions and stuff. Good at language, but poor at communicating.

49:14.000 --> 49:29.000
There are people who are good at communicating, good at communicating, would stand up there on stage and speak very well, but then small talks will get completely fumbled.

49:29.000 --> 49:50.000
So what I'm trying to say is that there are lots of different aspects to it. All those things are basically your brain deciding, I want to reshape myself in a way, this becomes, this XYZ becomes my first path, and those other things, I am not really interested so much about it.

49:50.000 --> 50:06.000
The moment your brain decides that, it will start reshaping itself in that manner, to the point it will re-optimize itself over and over and over, to the point I am bad at maths, nobody starts being bad at maths.

50:06.000 --> 50:26.000
Somebody at childhood deciding that I want to use those neurons differently, eventually finding that I can't really use those neurons anymore, they help me read somebody's facial expression better and understand whether they are in pain, are they hiding something, etc.

50:26.000 --> 50:42.000
So I'm just, it's not the exact one-inch-to-one relationship, what I'm trying to say is that we, brain is a very highly flexible machine, the computer, and we can decide whether to crypto-mine with it or get more frames on a video game.

50:42.000 --> 51:06.000
You can choose, you cannot do both at the same time, you get to choose. Now that was the hypothesis, which was fueled by, I got more fuel on that hypothesis while Rai was born around that time, so there is a thing called cognitive trade-off hypothesis, I think I talked about this a little bit.

51:06.000 --> 51:35.000
So some shims can identify, like they have very highly visual persistence, so if you show for a one-tenth of a second, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 on the screen, and then you wrap them up with just dots, and they understand the concept of, over the time of practice, they know which one is the order, like 1, then 2, then 3, they will just go and touch-screen, go through all those things.

51:35.000 --> 51:45.000
After that, near-perfection, not near-perfection, perfection, I haven't seen them make that mistake, they do that very well.

51:45.000 --> 52:06.000
So humans can't. You will have to be like, if I show you 10 numbers on a screen, random places, for 10 seconds, and then wrap it up with white markers, then you probably will be able to find up to 5 or 6 or 7 after practice.

52:06.000 --> 52:28.000
And it's not your shortcoming. The point is, the point that they're trying to make is that we abstract too hard in our brain. It does not make sense for us to have that consolidated, static information like that, and recognize that as is.

52:28.000 --> 52:37.000
But we had that. We have had that ability. We chose to drop it. We're trading it off for a higher level of abstraction.

52:37.000 --> 52:56.000
So when you're trying to communicate somebody, there were 10 dogs chasing me, like half a kilometer behind there, I need your help, you're trying to communicate that information, the exact positions of those dogs are not really as important anymore.

52:57.000 --> 53:08.000
What is more important, how do I very succinctly transfer that information to you, so that now you get to help me, and we can together drive off those dogs.

53:08.000 --> 53:17.000
But if I was solo, I would have benefit of knowing exactly how many of those are right behind me.

53:18.000 --> 53:25.000
So those critical bits of crystallized details are not really important anymore.

53:25.000 --> 53:37.000
What I'm trying to say in a roundabout way is that we create more and more higher level of abstraction, and by doing so, we trade off our superhuman traits.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.000
If somebody can do those number-clicking as fast, we'll call that person superhuman ability.

53:43.000 --> 53:58.000
Some people do that. Some people who are autistic but have savant-like abilities can tell you exactly 1969 to 2nd April which weekday was it.

53:59.000 --> 54:13.000
Those people are hyper-using, utilizing their part of the brain to do just that, whereas trading off something else, maybe their social life is struggling, suffering, or maybe...

54:14.000 --> 54:32.000
So my point was, can I create a situation where it seems like autism, and does that allow bandwidth for something else?

54:33.000 --> 54:43.000
So I intentionally, I don't know whether you have seen that, so when she was 6 plus, no sorry, almost 8, she was starting to speak.

54:43.000 --> 54:58.000
I took that, that she can take instruction, ta ta ta da da da, whatever I'm saying that she's saying back, so I took a video of that recording as a proof that she can speak, and she can follow the instruction.

54:58.000 --> 55:10.000
If I'm asking her to say some specific thing, she'll say that, but then I completely cut her off from focalizing things like learning language, I completely cut her off from that.

55:10.000 --> 55:26.000
What happened is that, so my idea was, most people, if we are trying to learn language, basically, visual processing, language processing, those two things take up huge amount of processing power of our brain.

55:26.000 --> 55:43.000
And if we ground up at the very childhood, we overburden ourselves with those things, I cannot tie her eyes, but if I can make sure that the need for language is reduced, then how else does it manifest?

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
Because it's a very flexible machine, it will find out other things to process, if you don't give something to process.

55:50.000 --> 56:07.000
So turns out, she is good problem solver and conscientious, all those things, as well as something that is completely oddball opposite end of it, she is also very good impact.

56:07.000 --> 56:16.000
And those two things happened, she would not be able to explain how or why or what, but she will know somebody needs coming down.

56:16.000 --> 56:27.000
She is better than both me and her mother combined on that aspect, and has been since as long as you can remember pretty much.

56:27.000 --> 56:35.000
So she understands human better, she understands problem solution, those things better.

56:35.000 --> 56:46.000
And the cost that we needed to pay is that up to three years old, she didn't speak in complete sentences anymore.

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
After that, we're like, okay, now you're time to get back on track.

56:51.000 --> 57:04.000
Now, she understands only one language well enough to form proper sentences that is English, she uses English, like writing and reading and speaking all those things are normally Bangladesh.

57:04.000 --> 57:14.000
She probably will expose her to that eventually.

57:14.000 --> 57:20.000
The point is, you need to sacrifice something in order to get understanding of other things.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
This was an experiment.

57:23.000 --> 57:29.000
Now, I don't I would don't want to subject this experiment somebody else's kids to this.

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
But I wanted to take that risk and see exactly how does that manifest.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
Probably someday she will blame me for the way it turns out.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
There will be always everything has a good side and a bad side.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
So probably she will find out a reason to be mad at me.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
But I'm kind of I'm not too mad at myself for trying this out or figuring that part out.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
She's still like I'm still running things.

57:56.000 --> 58:02.000
I hopefully none of those things like would put her in a massive disadvantage in her life.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
But yeah, that's pretty much where I draw the boundary.

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
Would I is it something that can be compensated after.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
So that's how it has been so far.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
Yeah, go ahead.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
If you have some questions.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Just just some parallel observations, but that can wait.

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
OK, so I like so the entire ethical dilemma.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
I understand that. I don't know how else to put it.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
And I don't know how else to like I can let it go.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I can not run an experiment.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
Nobody would be better for it.

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
So I don't know whether there's one good answer there.

58:49.000 --> 58:58.000
With that said, it does seem like if you can't delay your language processing as well as visual processing,

58:58.000 --> 59:04.000
and I did work on that as well, visual processing is not like tying up your eyes,

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
but the number of abstraction layers on visual processing like D and B,

59:10.000 --> 59:15.000
the mirror ring identifying them as different.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
If you can delay those kind of abstractions as well,

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
you actually have more bandwidth to process like learn other things faster.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
You will eventually like learn that as well.

59:25.000 --> 59:34.000
But what will happen is that more core neurons would be involved into like forming the baseline of the realities

59:34.000 --> 59:41.000
and the baseline principles itself than just remembering solid facts, which is what ends up happening.

59:41.000 --> 59:47.000
And once that ends up happening, like so what I mean by the core neurons,

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
so you see the hippocampus, the midbrain part, right?

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
So how do I go on about this much longer discussion?

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
OK, so if you consider in a very short form, there are three parts to our brain,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
the reptile brain, the mammalian brain and the homo sapiens brain,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
like the wrinkly part, the neocortex and stuff.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
So the reptile brain, that part understands pain and fear,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000
disgust, sorry, not disgust, pain and fear and pleasure and like what's the opposite of pain?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Play, play, sorry, that's pleasure.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And what's the opposite of fear?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I forgot, but courage, courage.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I mean, it's like an absence of the drive, yeah, the drive essentially.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:47.000
So that part is essentially most of the most of it is and the body functions,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
like running heart at the right pace, et cetera, et cetera, breathing at the right.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Those things are happening from that small brain side of things, right?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
The midbrain is the one that the hippocampus and the how do I show this?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Like somewhere around this, like if we cross that through or maybe look up the hippocampus,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
the shape of it, we end up using it as a memory storage.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
But it's not really a memory storage.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It is actually the map reduce section of the brain.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You can use it in a multiple different ways.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Anything that goes, you can put it as like map and reduce the actual the programmatic way of doing it.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Hippocampus will do that.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So you can not only remember facts, you can also remember methodologies itself or concepts itself.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So when we say why somebody is really good at a factory worker, right?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
A factory worker, what would be their skill?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:10.000
That hippocampus would be really good at doing that one thing over and over the particular move they are making to make more of the one thing that they can do.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And it will it will figure out a way to release dopamine and endorphin for doing that.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It will figure it will figure out to seek pleasure out of doing that thing over and over.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
But for some people, that would not be the case for them.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
They would figure out, I see.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So if I have these many people in this particular section of the factory that is just barely optimal amount of people that I need for that.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So if I put some of those people that are not really into it, they're causing more problems.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But put them into the like overseer role that might actually overall improve my output because now they're not problem of trouble makers.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
They are now. So what will happen end up happening?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That guy will end up becoming the manager of the people who run the company or run the factory, those kind of ways.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
That's what kind of ends up happening.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
People who see more concepts and stuff.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
How do you map, reduce and put them?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Some people in London tracks drivers.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
For them, it's the spatial geospatial location itself is the thing that they need to store.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So all those things actually basically go are going into the hippocampus.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The reason I'm trying to say this is that memory, you can trade off on memory as well.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
If you don't want to.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So hippocampus is like the processor of your computer in a sense.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It can have higher resolution, but lower number of and lower frequency of data.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So your brain waves.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000
That's the reason memory constellation happen when you're sleeping is because it's actually running the neurons through the exact set of drums.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That will happen in order to recall that memory.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So brain waves are basically the clock signals for your brain.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
They're happening all the time.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And if you want to recall something, you're basically training your brain as a particular set of dance to recall that information back.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000
While you're sleeping, your hippocampus and the midbrain part of things, they're basically consolidating that dance to associate with something.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It doesn't mean the older things are lost.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:37.000
It's basically you're overriding, overwriting sometimes, which is why sometimes in the dissociative set, you can find out memories that are that you didn't think even existed anymore.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So anyways, whereas the front, this part of the brain is better at lower resolution, high frequency, like the systolic array, kind of like basically the tensor processors.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Right.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Like GPUs are tensor processors.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:02.000
It's doing more processing, but it does not have the precision level is basically like eight bit, not 32, not 64.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Whereas the internal part that is 64, which brings me back to the initial topic that I was trying to say is that if you end up using those high precision neurons for just about remembering location data,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:28.000
just about remembering old memories, et cetera, then they're being spent like they're being spent for something that that's not the highest potential that you can use them for.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Now, it is not that easy to either reshape or repurpose those memories.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
You have to actually actively have to start forgetting things in order to train them or bring them up.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I don't need to remember the console, like stop solid details.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I just need to know the level of abstractions that goes on top of it.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And what is the fundamental theory that holds all of those together?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:05.000
If you can now remember that you can put more of those things and it creates the fundamental layer that if a child from the childhood, if you if somebody starts starts doing that.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And if that becomes optimization factor, by the way,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:17.000
it is insane how well you can teach your own brain to seek pleasure in doing something that it decided that it's pleasurable.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Like it decided it's pleasurable.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Now, it will decide when that happens.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I need to release endorphin to dopamine to seek it and endorphin when that happens.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
If that happens, anything in the world can be pleasurable to us, too.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So for somebody who finds interest in doing maths as a class four student of higher education, there's nothing holding you back.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You can basically at that point, you're becoming a math machine.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Like if you have the right books and basically the pointers in front of you, you can start breaking grounds.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Usually that's where the blocker comes in.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Usually you're not allowed to.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Usually there's no like preset ways to go on about it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Most people do not even try.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
We want to be a more rounded person.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
People, I don't see the problem.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000
The point is, if we start recognizing those factors and allow people who are like who already have figured out most of the times what you're talking about,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
like allowing kids to build their own curriculum, allowing like letting them figure out what they're interested about, etc.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Sometimes kids do find that out.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Somebody wants to draw.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Somebody wants to do maths.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Somebody wants to translate books, whatever.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I don't know.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
That's not the point.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
The point is, if somebody has that interest, use that, utilize that as the driving factor.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
In fact, you can use that as something as a treat.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Hey, I want to create you a more rounded person anyway, so you have to do the other thing as well.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But if you do this, you know what?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
At evening, you get to do more maths.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I'll give you a class 11's book.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Now, it's a win-win condition in both ways.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:24.000
We are really bad at, like traditional academic, like entire schooling mechanism is really, really, really bad at doing just that.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
In fact, it works the opposite way.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
It doesn't allow the learner to decide what they want to learn, like at all.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, sorry, rant over.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
No, it wasn't a rant. It was beautiful.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:53.000
In fact, like what I meant when you said I showed this, I was like, that's the amount of time I have so you can continue.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And again, I mean, this is what happens when we discuss.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So talking of the endorphin and things like right now, my brain has always identified that discussions with you are pleasurable.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So it tries to optimize for that situation.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.000
When that happens, I went into this discussion today and feeling low because, you know, I will be alone.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I knew that once I step into it, it's going to work out.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I sat with trying to write the topics, trying to do some pre-work as like it's OK, we'll figure it out.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
So that's like the brain saying that do not, do not give up on this.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:42.000
But at the risk of validating everything you said so far, especially in the context of Rai,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
If you I mean, I'd like to go into a few things here, mostly relating to my experience around this.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Do you think we can afford to have the time?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I have time.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:03.000
So I had a very peculiar childhood in that sense.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It was a very big mixed bag, except I did not have this.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I did not have parents who looked at bringing somebody up in this way.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
So a lot of these are take a shaker for me.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
But that take a shaker, like when I look back, I realized that these are the boundaries that they did not need to be strict.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The areas where they were strict, the areas where I was not allowed to do certain things, that just these factors moved around.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So, you know, when I said that I learned to speak late, I don't remember I having a problem with that.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I remember everybody else around me having a problem with that.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000
But so what I'm trying to say is that me growing up, I was this utterly confused kid.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Because conflicting expectations from parents, from neighbors, from school and certain places where I did well from their excessive expectation.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So they were all blurred up.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.000
But if I have to go back and redo, I would want to redo it in exactly the same way that you talked of.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Like I would rather that my parents knew this, you know.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So that's what I meant that at the risk of validating you, if I was the child, the pain of my childhood that I carry on.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I see myself feeling calm about the process that you talked of bringing up right.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And that is what I meant by the risk of validating you.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Because if I felt physically calm, if I were to place myself in that situation and feel that, OK, I don't see a friction because I did tradeoffs.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And that is what I wanted to come to, that I did tradeoffs.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And one of my earliest tradeoffs was, I guess, you know, we keep on coming back to maxims.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
One of my earliest maxims in life was it's OK to forget.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
It's never OK to stop thinking, to stop analyzing.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And so true. Yeah, 100 percent.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I'd rather forget and recalculate.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:33.000
So I was that kid who would finish exercise copies after exercise copies of maths at a certain point, like the age of I think class two to five ish.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Something happened after class five. I'll tell you that later.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:47.000
But the two to five, I finished exercise book after exercise book and I never remembered where I kept them because I did not need them because I was never going to look back at them.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
What was important is at that moment, I had solved something.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I can solve it.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I can solve it.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Another time, five times it comes, I can solve it.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Like with a high amount of certainty. That's what matters.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Why do you have to remember anyway in that case?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And my favorite kind of maths were proving the formulas.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Like where I was like, OK, this is how people had come to this formula, especially in algebra that we were taught at that point, the classic case in our text.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And like, OK, this is what is happening.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:30.000
And just going back at it, it was almost like rereading a story, seeing the characters form, even though you know what happens in the end.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:43.000
The formula for me was like knowing what happens at the end of the story, but I will read it, that story anyway, which is also why I keep on maintaining till date that I am never bothered by spoilers.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I am never bothered by spoilers because I know there is a certain end state that you're building up to, certain formulas, so to say, the summarized theorized compressed version of what there can be.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Now, very interestingly, that maxim that it's OK to forget has been one of the most conflicting things in my life growing up because everybody around me had the exact opposite view.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So I criminalized myself. I went into, so this is where you know the conflicts in personality kind of emerge, that I was constantly trying to be that boy that everybody else wanted me to be.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Whereas behind the scenes, I was always forgetting things. So what did I cope with? How did I cope with that? I built knowledge systems.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I was like, guess what? I can forget, but I can write down my notes in a way that I can get back to that. And of course, Einstein's that famous story, whether true or not, validated it, that my driver, like Einstein's driver saying that even my driver can answer that, that I don't need to remember facts.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I used to think that it's a great big thing, but it's that in truth, I could never come out to anybody and say that I forget. It was not acceptable.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:26.000
This makes me really sad because not only that this is the case for one kid where this has happened, this is happening at a large scale, at a mass scale.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:39.000
A lot of those people, a lot of those kids would be so broken that they would not even be able to recall it the way that you are doing. They will be that far broken.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Yeah, so then that maxim evolved to it's okay to forget. It's never okay to stop thinking and analyzing, but it's critically important to remember certain things so as not to repeat the same things again.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000
When that happened, that was the knowledge base forming part. And I have a very interesting...

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:15.000
By the way, before that, maxims are the opposite spectrum of memory itself, like the solid memory that I was talking about.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It is, it is.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So once you start remembering the maxims, that's when you don't want to remember the details.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:33.000
So again, which is why I cannot back this up with specific instances always. In very rare cases, I can give a specific anecdote, but in mostly this is the reason I speak big.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:43.000
And I have had partners, I have had friends who have told me that everything you say seems like a lie, seems made up. It is made up.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
That's the sensor problem.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It's not lie. It is made up.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Sensors want solid proof with receipt to show up.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:03.000
The world has enough resolution that you cannot, can never capture it to the highest amount of fullest resolution.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You don't have enough memory for it. Nobody does.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:18.000
So if by trying to remember things, you're subjecting yourself to a shallow view of the world or reality or only a part that you can bring or keep the receipts off.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Whereas if you start building the maxims, you can apply the principles like exactly the way you can apply operators on particular kind of equations, a gamma function, how a gamma function is solved.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
You can say that if I can do it this way, I can just say that, OK, this is just half tea and your salt.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I don't have to do it all over again. I don't have to show the steps.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
If you do this, the concept boils down to this.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And that concept is when but it makes a lot of people very, very uncomfortable, uneasy, the ones who are good at and have learned in that system to remember solid details with the receipts.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I have not found a solution to this problem.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:23.000
The only solution that I can think of is just you need to not you need to even I need to like reduce that exposure because that that interaction does not go well.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I was coming to that. I was coming to that in many sense.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I feel like I'm five years old.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So I'm pretty much in some sense like because, you know, of the amount of learning and then the unlearning and then coping with it and then suddenly hitting this.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:56.000
A certain level of clarity where the moment it gets back to that, you know, it's OK to forget as a very tragic aspect in relationships.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Because I would then evaluate relationships under the same parameters.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And I'm not just talking of romantic relationships.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I'm talking of any casual friendship. I'm talking of hooking up with somebody.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I'm talking of a teacher. I'm talking of a manager.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And I have till date never worked with a manager and never work nicely with a manager who insisted that I remember things.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I worked very well with managers who have been to who in who allowed me the space to think.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And even even if I have approached something previously, go over it again.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
But anyway, I was I was trying to talk of something very specific.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And I think it's like finally in life, I have that clarity of I feel like that is past.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So right now, even though it's it saddens, it is a past thing because I feel like I have understood how can I not fall into that trap again.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So sort of becoming your own parent of sorts, allowing building that space.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And one of the fundamental aspects of it is reducing exposure.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It is choosing very and I always used to think that why am I bad at socializing?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Because I always say everybody is supposed to be good at socializing.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
When I went into the concept of networking, why the hell am I bad at networking?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And then before you know it, I have a bunch of people I'm collaborating with.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Hang on. Where did this come from?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So a lot of that analysis has come together in this very cute childhood memory of my parents insisting that I learn to paint.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
You know, as every Bengali kid, you have a drawing teacher.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I had a drawing teacher.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Looking back, I realized that was the only queer, non gender affirming person in the area that I was allowed contact with.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And I was shit at drawing.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But you enjoyed going there.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I enjoyed going there because that person never critiqued exactly.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
My trees looked like lollipops.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Hang on a second. I might actually have just the thing.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Okay, go on. It will take me a while to find out.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
So there was something happening.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
My parents were very upset with that teacher.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
You can't learn anything. What is your son doing? What is happening?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I go to a drawing competition.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I think I had told you that was one of my favorite anecdotes.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I draw a mango.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Okay, I'm like four or five years old.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I'm sitting on the floor.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
My whole body is shaking.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I'm drawing there.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I've been drawing for half an hour.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
What does it mean?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I'm like, this is conceptually a mango.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So what does one do?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000
The brilliant mind in me labeled it M-A-N-G-O.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Just in case you don't know, this is a mango.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
So what happened as a result of that was I realized that why I liked going,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
this is looking back of course,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:28.000
that why I liked the drawing class while I was in there was I am a terribly visual thinker.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But my concepts, my visual concepts don't align with the real world.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
They are at best gross approximations because unless very important,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I do not care about the final details.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Because to me, it seems that the lollipop is sufficiently a tree to me.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
It can convey the tree-ness of a concept.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
In fact, that's the concept of stick figure.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
People who do not enjoy stick figure commons.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:08.000
That's why when I hit flowchart, computing books,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
these people don't know how to draw, but they're drawing.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
They're drawing everything.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And they're like, this means decision.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
This means storage.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
No storage looks like this.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Tell me where a storage looks like this, right?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Exactly.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Where does the decision do this?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
They just mean this side, this side, this side, this side, this side.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
That's the utility of it.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And it's like, this is how I was drawing all along.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So let me just draw.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And since then, I think in flowcharts.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I conceptualize using flowcharts.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And I draw the most weirdest drawings.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
But they still convey enough information to me.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
So there are two things that you're saying.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:01.000
But what I'm trying to connect back to is I chose that lack of granularity

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
at a very early age over choosing for the abstraction,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
deciding to focus at an abstract level.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
But also, in many ways, it's like going at warp speed.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I chose my destination.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
My destination was kind of far.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
So my option was beyond impulse drive, reach there in 200 years,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000
observe everything that is in the path, or go there at warp speed,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
at which point the stars are just zooming past,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
but the zooming past of stars that field itself is such a brilliant view to me.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:40.000
So very recently, I had to convince somebody of a particular analogy

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:49.000
about this particular, as in the trade of how you make it.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
The person was asking the question.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
The guy is super smart.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:04.000
But that sensory has to be solid sensory receipt for me to grab on to,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
otherwise I'm at a loss of, I cannot go into the nebulous territory.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
That kind of thing, right?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So when I make some predictions,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I'm saying that something like this kind of thing is going to happen.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Their problem is like, how can you know?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
How can you possibly know?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
There is no way to know that.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And my point was that is because you enjoy being in the midst.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.000
You enjoy solving the maze as a player playing the maze.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
What you're not understanding, not realizing is that

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
when stuck with the exact situation, when it hits me,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I immediately disqualify myself as a player,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
take myself off to a bird's eye view,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
and now that how you possibly know is not a question to me anymore.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
What did it cost?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Everything. I'm not a player anymore.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I cannot get the same enjoyment of solving the problem

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
the way you would do the sense of element of surprise,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
whether I should go this way or that way.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That element of surprise goes away.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
But this is not confusing to me anymore.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Now I can clearly see.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
In fact, that's what I'm good at.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
That's exactly what I'm good at.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
It took me quite a while to explain the concept like this,

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
because if you see that explanation itself is a nameless concept.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I am not physically moving up.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I'm just trying to convince the person that,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
hey, there are different ways to look at it.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Sometimes communicating that becomes really, really difficult,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
really, really hard,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
and the challenge there is over 90% people

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
only wants to see the world that

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:08.000
the rest 10% are usually weird, awkward, secluded introverts

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
that you have to go and find out to make that friendship.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Otherwise, you cannot find them out.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
They would exist in some shadows,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
knowing that nobody else is like me, nobody else understands me.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
But that's what struck me that,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
hey, the world is run by people who are really, really smart,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
but they have...

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000
So Star Trek had an episode about people who have exactly this kind of...

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
So Shaka, when the towers, when the walls fell...

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Shaka, when the walls fell.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Right? So if you think about that, what is it?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
That is still date marked as one of my most favorite Star Trek episodes ever.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And on that episode,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I have shown that episode to pretty much everybody who I would call close friends

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
or even acquaintances, even dates.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And the response is that...

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000
The response is the elicit, tells, leaps and bounds,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
at least the information that is relevant to me about them.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So I kind of use that episode as an acid test.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I was like, let me categorize you, you know?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And your response to Timba, his arms wide,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
people laugh, those who are laughing.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And of course, it can be humorous, I can appreciate that.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I mean, you have to understand that it is speaking to the other end.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
It is for the people who do not speak the way,

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
only for the people who do understand the symbolism aspect of things.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
For them, you don't need to go into the details.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
It doesn't have to mean exactly...

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
The other set of people immediately take to it.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
The next day they are like, Timba, his arms wide.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
So that is the reason. I don't remember a whole lot of things.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I cannot tell you a whole lot of deals from Star Trek.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
This I do remember.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Oh, it is because I rewatched this episode.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
No, no, it is even for me.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Last was two weeks back.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I see, I see.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Completely understood, but that goes to show,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I am, of course, I don't want to remember a lot of things.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
But this, I do remember.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I don't have an option, I don't have a choice.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.000
This represents so much of me that it is worth remembering as is, right?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Because as you said, it works as a litmus test

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
to find out that exact set of people.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Either they already know or when they are first exposed to it,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
would be like, oh yes, this is it.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So in either of the cases, the point that I was trying to make is that

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
that difference, the contrast is really stark.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And even though in that particular, in Star Trek,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.000
there was a somewhat of a closure, somewhat of a resolution,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
in real world, there actually isn't as much.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:10.000
One side would turn the other side as clumsy and stupid and move on.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
That's practically what is there to it.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And I guess what I'm trying to say is that I kind of relate to that other species.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And the initial, like in that same episode,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
like until Picard actually figures that out,

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
others dismissing that we can't ever translate this language,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
even with our sophisticated tooling,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000
is the response that I have gotten from society when I spoke in abstracts.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Which is why I always thought,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
like instead of associating myself with that species,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I always try to associate myself with Picard

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000
because it is fundamentally, if I do understand that, good.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
But if I don't have the intent to understand that,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.000
if I completely live in a denial of this cannot be understood,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
then that's not the life I would want.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I would want the prospect of knowing the things that I don't know yet.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Sometimes, at some level,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I would be the people who do not understand or speak that exact kind of symbolism,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
at which point I would want to have a mind open enough

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
for me to be allowed to download that thing.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Anyways, where I was going with this?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I was going with, yeah,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:47.000
the percentages are really stacked up against that kind of communication.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
It would be, this is one of those things that I would want to solve as well.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Find more people around me who can see this and understand this

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
and understand that, okay, we have a,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000
that person is not one of island because that's how it manifests.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Until you find somebody else like you on those kind of things,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
for a better part of your life,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
you basically don't know anybody else.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
You just end up thinking that you are screwed up in some certain way,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
which was my case as well.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And that has been a very,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I think in many a sense, low days still reinforce that.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It has been practiced for so long

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
that basically depressive spells just reinforce that thought.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
But somehow now, coming out of depression,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
the phases when they come out of depression, that goes away.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So it tells me that it's an acquired trait.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But I think one of the things that I,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
hearing your story, that story is what I understand is that

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
you actually valued the people around you or surrounding you

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
a lot more, their opinion and their perspective

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
and whether they understand you or not.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I think that's a lot of part of your pain.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
It is.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And I think that is why the conscious choice

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
to then reduce exposure kind of came to,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
because I operate on this obsessive learner mode.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And to me, there was enough to learn from everyone

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and everything around me.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I might be learning something different.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
So I saw different worlds.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I saw different worlds in my family, in the neighbors' families,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
in my cousins' family, in school,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
in the families of my other schoolmates.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And I saw that there was enough to learn from all of these.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And I looked at it as it's up to me to assimilate

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
and make what I must out of those.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And the downside of that was I was opening myself wide

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000
to even the drudge of the system,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000
not realizing that at which point I have started

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
mimicking the same things that those people are telling me.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Instead of being that observer,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I have now become the person living that.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
So that is fair.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
That is the kind of thing which needs either a full dissociation.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
So that was my mental state at that point,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
that why did my brain go into dissociation?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
It needed some place to think quietly outside all of this.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Now I realize how important that is in life

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
to actually distance myself.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I was like, okay, let's deconstruct life,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
deconstruct to the point where there is nothing,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and then build back from that and see what is it that I want to add.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And that has worked out pretty well so far.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So which is why I said that my life experience

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
would actually be validating the approach you are taking towards.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And it is simply that I had to choose that

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
in the face of many other obstacles,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
and I would have very much preferred if those obstacles

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
were not put in the first place.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
So what I am trying to say is that you might find

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
just saying that I felt like I understood English better

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
after I learned programming,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
because I understood logic,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
and I could apply logic in that way.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
But at the same time, one of the things I felt like

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I would be good at, but I have never made the time

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
to go into is sign language,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
because I have trouble.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I know it is a conscious drain of my energy

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
when I am verbalizing.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
So choosing to do these long conversations

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
are a conscious choice.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I know that is how much I am draining.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So I am consciously aware of that.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
So that just makes me think that if somebody like Rai

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
would be more open to understanding a sign language,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
not needing to verbalize,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
not needing to work with things,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and maybe just get better at that,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
just another form of expression,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
and it doesn't hurt.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
You can learn any other language later.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
There is that much more value behind it.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
But why I am saying why sign language?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It is not just the vocal processing.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
It is that sign language makes you think in certain abstractions,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
certain other categories of abstractions,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
which don't directly map to your spoken language.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Right.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I think the influence right now,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
she has blank slate in front of her.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
We don't restrict her from doing anything practically speaking.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
She can do pretty much anything we just observe.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
What happens is that the form of entertainment she is consuming

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
kind of dictates where she is going,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
or things that she is practicing, etc.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
So Nakamo as like a girly Nakamo,

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000
those kind of things she picks up now.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
So again, that's a weird, longer story.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
The gender norm gets imposed on essentially.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
We are trying to keep it as fluidic as possible.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Like, okay, we are never going to tell you who you actually are

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
until unless you figure that part out.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Right.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So what ended up happening is that at the playground,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
she had to assume a gender in order to proceed forward

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
because the kids did not know how to treat.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And the kids were given that from their parents and all.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So basically, it had to be applied on in order to proceed forward.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
It was becoming a blocker.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
It still is a blocker.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I don't understand why that is the case.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But that is the case.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I was trying to find out where does that gender identity come from?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
How do you end up deciding that you are one or not the other?

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I can share my experience here.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And again, maybe this would be parallel a lot,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
at least if not parallel that some use case, let's say case studies.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
So the way I have come to understand gender,

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I have always been this confused kid, right?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Because something that I feel was very different from what others told of me.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
And I have gone through phases.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I've gone through my genderable phase where I was like, I'm strongly trans.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Then I went through and that was like my late teenage.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Then it was like, oh, no, I have to identify as this cis man

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
in order to be accepted into the society.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And again, went into fuck that.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000
But at that fuck that, I mean, in between was this trying really,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
really hard to play the game by the rules to see for once.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I mean, that was like my college days.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
That's what I'm saying.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
You trust the system way too much.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
No, no, no, no.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I don't trust it now.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I'm just saying at that point, it was like, OK, it looks like my way is not working.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I'm clearly not getting across.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I'm just causing more confusion.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And then my college days were like, let's play by the rules.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And I realized that I got tired of that very quick.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
That's not working out.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:35.000
But how I describe my understanding of gender now is that it's a function.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It's just like I think of morality that it's a computed function.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
You throw in parameters.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I'm going to give you an output.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So my favorite way of saying is that my gender today or my gender now is this,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
like a bouncing volleyball.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
That's it.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000
But what I'm trying to say is that that, however, hit a roadblock, that approach.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And I realized that there is a certain value in templatizing,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000
templatizing to my nearest possible accepted thing.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
It's kind of like having avatars, you know, like in a game you have created a certain avatar.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And I'm like, OK, in this scenario, this is how I represent.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
So now how I represent my gender is I consider myself non-binary.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And I consider myself non-binary from the very fact that I believe in breaking down binaries unless it is computing.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So in that sense, binary is just a matter of solidified state.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Is there an influx?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000
But then if you break down the binary, binary is the most bare basic solid form, the crystal.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Yeah. So my stupid person can understand.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
So basically, that's why it helps to keep it that way.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Yeah. So in this sense, I'm just tying this back that this ties back to my understanding of nonsense that I said at the beginning of this discussion.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Right. It is beyond sense.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:09.000
So in that sense, when I'm talking of non-binary, it is basically it's not saying that it's not it's not to be interpreted as not to.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000
It is to be interpreted as something that cannot be confined to two because it is beyond that.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It is beyond two. OK, so then this is my job.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:33.000
So the way I express my gender now is that I would like to understand the recipient and portray according to that.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
So there are some thumb rules I go by in terms of pronouns.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:48.000
If it is an English speaking audience, I insist on they them because they're the necessity to break down binaries is that much more important in the usage of pronouns.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:56.000
But when I am talking to a native Bangla speaker and they ask me, what pronouns do you use?

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000
My answer to them is anything you want, because my mother tongue does not have a concept of gendered pronouns.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:11.000
So I don't see the value of introducing an artificial thing there because Bangla does not need pronouns.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:22.000
But the moment I'm talking to somebody outside the Bangla thing or outside a language or especially a language that heavily genders the pronouns and like then I would be like, here, just please be conscious of this.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
But then also there is a matter of presentation.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So the gender is an identity. There is a presentation there is as in the internal and the external aspect of it as well.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So the presentation part, I realized that there are certain ways of presenting myself in public, like given our current legislation, all my documents carry mail and I am okay with that.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I used to be very upset with that, but now I'm okay with that because I am taking this within the confines of this system that in a system that casts me into two buckets, I have to reach the most acceptable form unless I explicitly agree at some point to present myself as trans.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:16.000
But in my daily presentation, and again, this is where I have a beef with most of the queer community, which is also why I never gel well with the queer community and I have tried.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:26.000
The majority of them is I do not have the time to work on my presentation because there is a natural way in which things happen and I let that slide.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
So at which point my presentation comes off as mostly male.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:39.000
But then when I'm conscious, it again, it's on the audience. So I'm kind of that much. I have built, I have templatized this to the point.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:48.000
So what I'm saying is, it's probably important to explain to Ray that within that context, I don't have the time to work on my presentation.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Even if you are choosing to represent yourself as a girl, it's important to remember that it is within that context. Do not identify that with your identity.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Yes, yes. So the entire part about is that an immutable part of my identity.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000
We always give her enough time to work on my presentation.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:24.000
So the entire part about is that an immutable part of my identity.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:33.000
We always give her enough solid grasp to hold on to that it isn't if you don't want it.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I am not going to shape you in any one way or the other. If you want the binary identity to be yours, be my guess.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:52.000
If you don't want to be, that's also fine. I don't care. I wouldn't I wouldn't give you an weapon in either direction or not.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:06.000
If you ask questions, I'll give you the answer. And yeah, so my personal way of understanding this, like at the way I represent myself is that it's more like a HSL scale.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000
It is. It is. It's kind of like HSL, right? Because the L is the thing that is often overlooked.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:29.000
So I knew that you were going for that as well. That's why I've said this, because not only gender, also for sexuality, I think I can have that much that it's not about the exact which value of the color will you're choosing.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:42.000
It matters a whole lot how the saturation and luminosity affects. What if you are red and you have a very high saturation, but the luminosity is zero?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:50.000
The outward expression would be black. You would not be presented as red. You'd be black in that case, right?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:46:06.000
So that is where I think my identity falls in. I am very much like I'm in love with that androgynous representation of some like I would I you have probably never seen me project myself as like overly manly man or overly feminine.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Like man or something, whatever that is, I don't go. It's not that it's like basically I reject the concept of having that as a strong part. That is not the strong part of my identity.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I am various other things. And I would choose any where on the spectrum as long as the luminosity is zero. So it doesn't matter whether I'm red or blue or green.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Luminosity is zero means I'm black. And that's the part like that's all you need to know. Move on. Let's talk about something else that I find more interesting.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And I'm not saying that this is not interesting. I'm just saying that that's where from childhood since childhood, I never really wanted to put so much value into it.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So a lot of people complain that didn't bother me.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Eventually, I got daddy go. It's probably a little bit less than the point is like it never was a problem for me.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:16.000
My identity was not like I want to go like I don't know. I don't know. That never really bothered me.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Or do I need to like present the presentation part? Do I need to do that in order to present myself some other that also didn't bother.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So either of the cases that so I am very comfortable and happy with that null kind of in a way. Right. So and I'm fine with this.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:48.000
So any I I don't think anybody needs anybody else's approval for this matter or even like the what do you call that?

01:47:48.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Yep. And after like 10, 12 years of trying to identify my gender sexuality and having gone through the pretty much all the possible literature that I have access to, I think you were very right.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And I think I usually say no to this, but I have to humble up and accept that a lot of my earlier actions in life have been motivated by pleasing others, pleasing or accepting the people immediately around me.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:23.000
And I don't think I can change it. I don't think I can change it, which means my only option is to choose who's around me.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Right. So you remember Mossfest or something in London, there was this thing that Larissa had done this.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Larissa had done this. I'm not sure if you were in that session. I think it was one of those London sessions.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Robin Boo was there to remember. She got people to stand in a line and there was this take a step forward if you agree or backward if you disagree.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.000
And there was this question of if you don't identify as a cishet person or something.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.000
And I stepped back and there were people like, what, you?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Oh, we thought you were this extroverted, very handsome man.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:20.000
The only thing I'm willing to take from that statement is handsome.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I'm willing to take. But see, the point is that I'm just trying to tell you that you have not lost much.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:40.000
My entire study into this, trying to really understand things, because it feels like there is something really big happening here in the way that people are expressing their gender, sexuality, the expression.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I love pride. I have been into one or two of those marches. I love that.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I love the openness that happens within that, knowing that this is that contextual boundary outside.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:03.000
This is not safe. But the thing that I could not take into account was that there is this understanding.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And again, this is a criticism of the majority of the people I have come across that you got to show it, that you got to flash it and you got to celebrate it.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:22.000
And I do, because I do. But here is what this process is taking a very small is running on low priority.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
There is a thread running. Yeah, it is keeping a check.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Exactly. I'm very weird. It gets weird to how do I project it.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:42.000
But I 100% agree what you're saying here is that from a priority-wise perspective, there are all the other things that I'm very much more interested about than this.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I have no disrespect for it. I understand, but I'd rather put that in the back of my head.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Then look at that. I'm just talking. Why does my color schemes when I design something go to red and black?

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:14.000
There is a reason. And the reason is this. I want to choose the luminosity level based on the interaction, based on the person, based on the subject at hand or the situation at hand.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:21.000
If I want to show you the colors as they are at that point, all I got to do, boss, is increase the luminosity slider.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But first I need to verify that you are worth it or that I am feeling I like dark. I like the lack of light. It helps me think there is there are many, many variations.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:44.000
So if you want to plot the gender on a certain spectrum, also include my willingness to divulge that or to take that as a primary topic.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:55.000
But here I am discussing gender in a way that I typically would bypass. I have learned that I don't need to educate others.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I also went through this phase where I was this vocal proponent and something was not right. And what was not right, it felt like being an anchor for Republic TV.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I mean, yeah, I am on the news. Yeah, I am shouting. But is this worth the news? I mean, yeah, it appeals to a lot of people. But is this worth the news?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:31.000
So in that sense, the worthiness, remember last session, we had this discussion what is worth doing on that worthiness scale.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:40.000
This is not something to ignore. It is something to prepare and let it stay. It will step in. It is a bounding function.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.000
It will step in if that part gets over like somebody forces something out.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yeah, I think one of the good analogies, at least to me, in my mind, it sounds like a good analogy, is that some people need being told over and over, I love you, as in a form of like, hey, to make it hit home and constant reminder of like, hey, you are loved, somebody else loves you, essentially.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:17.000
For them, it is necessary in that way. For me, it doesn't seem necessary. It does not mean that love is not there.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Right? It is the same way. Celebration is the exact same way. I don't need to be reminded or remind anyone for that thing to be exactly that same way.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:47.000
It is just that I don't have to celebrate it or put it forward for everybody else. I don't need that. It is inside my head. Whether you approve of it or disapprove of it, it doesn't matter. I couldn't care either way, which was the point I was getting to. I really didn't care what others think.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And that, my friend, is the fundamental difference, which is why I said that I better own up to this, because there is no other way of understanding the differences in your and my approach.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Yeah, I care very less about what others thought about. And I think the credit goes to my dad, essentially. Because when you are a kid, your worldview is forming as if there is the ideal high state of some kind.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Somebody you are trying to idealize. At that point, if that somebody actively breaks it down to you, that idealism is a play you should.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:44.000
In a way, if you want more bandwidth, you start being skeptical. And at the void of all of it, after being skeptical and trying all different ways to question that thing, you still wouldn't break it.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:53.000
That's a pretty good thing. Then it's worth being a fan of. But everything eventually breaks down at some point.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:00.000
The point is, I do make mistakes. That was my dad's thing. I do make mistakes.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:14.000
So when that was like, I want to idealize this person, this person is somebody I can idealize more than anybody else that I can see. But this person is actively going out of their way to prove that they also make mistakes.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Then how much others do. And at that point, can I take anybody's any words for granted? Everything is basically nebulous until proven. I'm not gonna, this is not something that I'm committing to.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I heard what you were saying. I'll come back to it in three days, maybe. In between, I'll ask around. So in that way, never nobody said to me was immediately committed, I felt good or bad or anything. It didn't really matter.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Most of the time it's like, okay, that was yet another stupid thing. For the lack of a better resolution. That is true in most cases, only when you take that as an assumption, that's only when.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And for them, probably that's the baseline. I don't mind. But for me, I now know where does that fall down. So in that way, I never cared about that included teacher and everybody else.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:22.000
My point, my problem ended up becoming, am I a pathological, like I am, am I like, what are my personality?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
The perfect sociopath.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Yeah. So how much of a sociopath am I? And the point is, that I cannot discuss with anybody. I had to go on out of my way to find out books and resources about what are the traits of a psychopath? What are the, how?

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:48.000
And then what I eventually realized is that, again, if you go by executive functions, there are lots of psychopathic tendency in various different people.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:57:10.000
What ended up happening, I understood very early in my life, like 12, 13, around that time, is that good faith, as in not trying to act as if you are trying to harm somebody, is one of the best thing that you can do to not become the monster that you don't want to be.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And that was pretty much, that was pretty much it. Like once that was the understanding that one of the, one of the baseline like maxim or assumptions that knowingly.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:31.000
So I, my interpretation was, I wouldn't do something that I cannot, with pride, explain to my grandkids.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:40.000
So if I'm doing something, anything, if I cannot take pride in doing that, to explain to my grandkids, because a lot of stupid things I will do.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:49.000
And as long as I'm able to laugh at that end, like at the end part of my life. So this is, this is a stupid, not malicious, right?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:55.000
So even if I do stupid things, that's fine. Malicious, not fine. I shouldn't do that.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:02.000
And that was my cut-off. If I cannot explain that with pride to my grandkids, that's what I don't do.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:12.000
That defined a lot of things that I have or haven't done in my life, but that's what, that's what it boiled down to in my understanding of, the understanding of bona fide, like understanding of good faith.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I did not know that by that term or understanding or knowledge. I just understood that sometimes people end up doing things that are way too selfish.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And they know that they just would create justification for it, weave justification for it in order to absolve themselves of that.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I wanted to know that, hey, I am actively making a mistake here. So that's the part that only helped me.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Yeah, I think last 20 years almost has been just like not a lot of other things, just trying to understand myself better and better and better.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Yeah, like I said, if I'm five years old, that was the counter, like that was the limit I hit in life.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:00.000
And you know what? This calls for a complete reset. It seems like certain things were working and things broke very badly.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:10.000
And now there is a need for a complete reset because there is this underlying hunch that something I'm not paying attention to.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And the something I was not paying attention to was this constant voice that I was suppressing in order to what I thought adapting to the environment.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Yeah, anyhow, this was illuminating in many ways and in many sense, this kind of I guess validates what I thought about you.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:43.000
And I just looked at the photo that you shared.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Oh, so when you talked about that lollipop trees, that was that was the first watercolors.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.000
That one was and I was forced to put more colors.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000
It was very faded. I increased the saturation as well.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I was very much I was very much like the saturation was really faded.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:20.000
And also the tent is tent and the trees are lollipops.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I posted it a long time back when you were talking about that.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I had seen, but then I had seen and parked it. I'll come back to that. But yeah, that is how a brain operates.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So see, I don't know how to tie this back because I don't think there is any point in tying this back as much as taking the complexity of everything that we have been talking of.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:01:01.000
And the only valid summary that I guess you can make of everything that we have discussed is kind of boiling down to the fact that what was it that Shukumar Rai really retained in his writing.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:08.000
It's that childishness, so to say, the ability, the tenacity, the fluidity.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:17.000
And if I am to expand the maxim that has kind of come at this point from that, it's OK to forget.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000
It's never OK to stop thinking or analyzing, but it's terribly important to remember certain things.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And at all times, the only principle worth dying for is retaining fluidity, is retaining the ability to change.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Pretty much, pretty much this, right? I see you have a dialectic oscillation. I can just get what you can want to say from the headings.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Pretty much, yes. I was going for this.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Summarize, summarize. That was actually pretty good. Keep, keep going.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:25.000
And so this has kind of boiled down to this one set of principle that how do I understand the concept of liberty, the concept of justice is also through this lens.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And if you remember me saying that I hold on to this fact that collective human consciousness or collective human memory is spontaneous, that humanity forgets way more often than we want to think we do.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:55.000
And there is value in that forgetting. That forgetting is just making space for something new to occupy that.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:04.000
For me, the composting of food materials through fungus into soil is a sort of forgetting.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Through me, death is a form of forgetting. And simultaneously, the ability to analyze, like when I say analyze, I mean, what is it but observe and understand.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:48.000
And that small, ah, that's what, you know, that ting that goes on. I would like to think it is as primal as, you know, if you ever find yourself in that dark, dark night in a forest where you can't see anything, you don't have a light with you.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:04:11.000
The first thing that happens is your other senses get stronger. You sense the wind. At that point, it is okay to not see. It's when the next you encounter light, the light feels blinding to the point that you realize that the majority of the universe is dark.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:37.000
And it is not dark because there is no light. It is simply dark because we have so far looked at it through this lens of perceiving photonic particles into our eyes, observing them through these certain lenses, which is why the first time an x-ray imaging was taken, people were like, how is there so many things?

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:54.000
And if one thing an astrophysicist will tell you is there are so many different wavelengths to observe the universe in, that was probably, yeah. And there are so many ways we don't know yet.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:14.000
So what is the one thing that we absolutely must ensure that happens, especially if, let's say, I would like to think that the contribution to the human evolution, like at one point I used to be that very strong classic textbook misanthrope.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I say, like, I got nothing to do with evolution. But now I kind of realize the evolutionary responsibility in a certain different way. There is, of course, procreate, push your genes forward, carry on the human line.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Lucky for me, there are many others doing that. I can choose not to. So again, it's that focus, you know, that it's that trade-off.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Yeah, of course. But the only reason that I chose to, like, I understand exactly what you're saying.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:06:00.000
No, again, I am the one thing I was very glad is that you chose to have a kid because I like here a specimen like me has chosen so experimental conditions available without having to invest.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Which I just want to point out, this is the value of a collective upbringing, that the reason why communities, kids who grow up in communities tend to be that much more well-rounded emotionally or empathically,

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:37.000
the sharp edges that we have had to smoothen out over our lifetimes that we will continue to and we will never reach the sort of smoothness that let's say your kid is going to go into never having that sharp edge in the first place because it began with that well-roundedness.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Right. Is that the evolutionary responsibility is also to carry on this knowledge that change is essential.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Yeah. And if you are to sum up that whole maxim that I told about the life, it boils down to this, that change is essential at every point, ensure that change is possible, no matter however written in stone.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
If anything is written in stone, make sure you have something to break that stone down.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Yeah. It's okay to write in stone. It's okay. Why is it okay to write in stone is you want something to last longer, longer than other relatively other things which take relatively lesser time.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:39.000
But as long as we are bound by time, as long as we are bound by this moving towards the entropy state, we are still bound by certain finite conditions and one of them is that you cannot stop change.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:47.000
So why fight it? Which is why the best way it's not about swimming upstream or downstream.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:08:00.000
It is completely about do you have the fucking boat and then something might happen because of which the stream reverses.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Can you respond to that change? If you were very strongly going upstream, upstream, upstream, the moon starts rotating the other way around, the earth starts spinning the other way around, gravity flips, another earth comes on top of the earth and suddenly your stream goes upstream.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:34.000
The point is this, why is it okay to forget? It's okay to forget because the only way to allow change within a finite state machine that is our brain is to free up circuits for change.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:41.000
The reason it is not okay to stop thinking and analyzing is because situations may change.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:50.000
You cannot take something that was true or known to be true earlier if you face that again you've got to re-evaluate even if you come to the same answer.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:58.000
You keep on re-evaluating, might not be looking at it fine enough that you spot the finer decimal points.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Why is it absolutely critical to remember certain things? It's absolutely necessary to remember how did you bring about change the last time you encountered something like this.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Which again boils down to the final part that fluidity. So if you then take this, apply it to gender, it means that fluidity is of paramount importance.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:41.000
You apply it to justice, it means the ability to reinterpret and reinterpret that fast enough so that by then the situations have not changed under which things had come in.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:47.000
That a process of justice that takes too long is an outdated process.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Exactly the challenge with the justice system is right now. The world moves too fast for it to be caught up.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:05.000
But that does not mean that you compromise on your variables and arrive at a simpler form of justice. It does not mean that justice has to be handed out right then.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:13.000
What I'm saying is increase your computation power, increase the ability to parallely process multiple things.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:31.000
And it is this ability to parallel process that again ties back to why brains like mine or probably yours and many other people like us tend to ignore the finer details of life in favor of acquiring, observing the complexity.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:43.000
The only way to observe the complexity is to distance yourself to be able to broaden your field of vision or rather to get more things into your field of vision.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Yeah, I think that's the only way that I can sum up what we got.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Yeah, so that's fantastic by the way. The one only reason I was bringing out that document is because part of it about what we are saying that what the childishness, the neoteny.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Yeah, one, the antithesis of the will to power is will to play.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I was showing in that section is that how will to power, will to power and will to play are not so.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Shukumar Rai is basically celebrating that will to play in a very rough sense.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:44.000
My point was they are not, they basically access like where those are two different extremes.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:12:00.000
But actually they live on a balance. Both need to be there. The will to power and the will to play. Both need to be there because what is will to power is the exercise to play.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:11.000
So exercise of power is the will to play. If you want to play that means what? You are capable of and allowed to play.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:21.000
So similarly what is will to power? The intent to play. Why would you want to act like am as power?

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Is that you want to see some certain thing to happen that is your play and because you see the threat in it like I am not allowed to do that, how do I ensure that I am allowed to play?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Is that how you go on about it, the will to power? So anyways that is the part I was trying to show is that the relationship between those two things, the necessity for one or the other even though at its core, at my core I am very much of a will to power kind of person like at a pathological level.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:20.000
The exposure to Sukumar Rai opened me up to seeing that other side where the will to play is necessary. It is not one dimensional. The dimensionality of it, the spectrum, I need to see that and I need to position myself well enough not to become an extremist of either of the sides.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Because that is what ends up happening. All the dictatorship, all the authoritative approaches to life as well as to state, to company, to governing anything basically boils down to people seeing it in a very one dimensional way and not having enough understanding of the will to play part.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:14:04.000
So I think for anybody in a leadership role they should be exposed to this will to play in their own languages but to meet Sukumar Rai helped in that sense. That is the part that I was trying to bring back up.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:15.000
So it had other parts as well, the oscillation part of things. I wanted to discuss that but I think we are too late for this. Let us push it back to the next week.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
I do not mind.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:23.000
No, it is okay. I do not want to associate this discussion with a sense of exhaustion.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I think I am like five hours away from exhaustion.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:38.000
That is okay. Let us break it off here and let us look forward to the next one.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:15:00.000
So the next one is where I would want to talk about the concept of thesis-antithesis synthesis and how it is missing one parameter, the hypothesis and why that is necessary.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Why it is somewhat incomplete without and why having it is actually really really more complete from a scientific or technological perspective. That is the analogy that I am going to bring it down to essentially.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:25.000
So let us look at it next week.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:32.000
So that is it for this week. Let us catch back up next week. I am going to stop this.
