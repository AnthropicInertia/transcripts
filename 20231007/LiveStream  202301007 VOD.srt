1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Today is 7th.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
7th?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, shit.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll change the...

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Stream is live.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Change the date.

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
7th.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, I started recording.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My bad.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, hey.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome to the stream.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We already started talking about something and then realized that we haven't been streaming.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I have been recording instead.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, let me quickly correct that mistake.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And so, now that you go live, we were talking about how do we want to approach the format

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the medium and the brand.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, let me quickly correct that mistake.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And so, now that you go live, we were talking about how do we want to approach the format

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and the medium and the brand, et cetera, et cetera, and what are the things that drives

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the momentum as well as what are the things that gives us more energy to continue forward

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
doing the same thing as in things that we enjoy.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, with that said, with that brief context, I don't want to dig too deep into that because

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we were in the middle of our conversation.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll hand it over to Kosta who was speaking at the last moment.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Go ahead, Kosta.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The question was that how do we use the things that we have now to kind of build, you know,

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
not to call it a content pipeline as much as different areas of work that we want to get to.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And the core of it is that there are a bunch of ideas floating around that is probably

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
valuable to audiences beyond just the two of us.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And what we would like to do is maybe take them into forms of blog posts as a podcast,

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
eventually building onto some software, some, you know, usable things.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But then instead of looking at these things as separate things that we have to produce,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
like not to be in a stage where, you know, hey, write 10 blog posts this month,

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
two podcasts this month, and I don't think either of us wants to get into this.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So instead, one of the suggestions was that why don't we use these weekly discussions

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
as stage zero, which is the most malleable part of the entire initiative.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Over three to four such iterations in a month, we would have three to four such sessions,

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which brings us to stage one, at which point distil or extract the information

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and categorize the information that has been created in these discussions,

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which then goes on to build blog posts, goes on to inform podcasts,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but then and any other forms that come in.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But for any audience member, anybody listening in, the part that I was just saying last

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and I guess there would have something different or addition to say here is I see different

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
levels of engagement as different levels of what we were talking about the orbit model in

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and how that kind of changes the concept of looking at communities as a funnel

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that you get community members at the top of the funnel, they slowly filter down.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Instead of that, look at communities as objects orbiting around the central body.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The central body of that solar system, so to say, would be the initiative

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
or the project that you are building people around.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So in that sense, these stages are sort of the inner workings.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So these are very inner layers of the orbit.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And then like blog posts and all you can get to how much more malleable that form is

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
for us to maybe act on any feedback that comes in.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So that's probably a bit vague.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But the idea is that we start with this and roll out anything new that comes off of this data.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How does that sound?

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, that sounds good.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To put my focus back into the part that you started with, not to call it a content pipeline,

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
but the stages.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How about I kind of lay down those like stages as they're coming into my head

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and then figure that part out.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So say, for example, the first initial part would be thinking out loud,

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
which is what we are doing.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So first audience is us, like you and me, essentially, right?

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So basically, we are thinking ourselves out loud.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And we are doing so through this streaming thingy.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So some people might want to watch this live and participate in that process.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They would pose the question live.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm not talking about right now.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm talking about in its more mature stage.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So they would want to come along for the journey, essentially,

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and be live participants of what is being discussed.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's stage one.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We are the stage zero.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That is stage one.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The next ones would be the people who watch the world next day.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Another layer would be people who hang out on our Discord server or something like that,

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
something of that kind, like more real-time community support.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not saying Discord has to be it.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It can be Slack. It can be Discord.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It can be some other more decentralized or federated mechanism, metrics.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's not the point.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The point is like real-time communication, more of a real-time communication platform,

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
where they can post questions, have discussions on that.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So it basically becomes a community, like another layer of community.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And the layer above that becomes the ones who read the blog posts or newsletters,

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
whatever you want to call it, on a particular time basis.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Or maybe there will be a level below that,

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
people who see the curated posts on different mediums we share it on,

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Twitter or LinkedIn or other places where it gets shared.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They read about it.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, they understand that there are these people doing something called Anthropoceneershare

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or something like that.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And then the layer above that is people who subscribe to the channels or blog posts

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and watch the video when they're published on a monthly basis or something like that.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So these can be the things.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I may have missed some things.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you give it some time and figure out maybe we can document this whole thing together

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and pack together, then we have a more complete picture of how to go about it.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I think that's already a reasonably good distribution.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And in all of these cases, like you said, it's also the level of engagement,

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
which is what I called as malleability of the project under the hood.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because at this stage, any question coming in, we can respond to that,

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
which will influence the course of the discussion.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Over time, anything that happens in the community can influence the course of discussion

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in the next iteration.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Anything that comes up through the blog posts will probably improve that blog post

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and potentially improve something that we write next.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, you know, like how malleable, it's like your distance from the center.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So that's what I'm saying. This is a good way of you have basically adopted that orbit

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
of thinking into this.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I love that model though.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I love that model.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Cool. So that kind of that kind of like so basically we are aligned there.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Would you say like or do we have any kind of decoherence there?

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because I would love to like those are the points more important to me than

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
like setting up the base correct is more important to me than the particular topic of this month

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
or topic of this day, essentially.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's what I'm saying.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Because unless we figure out a way to sustainably do this for a long course of time, right?

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Doing a magic trick for a day is not what is going to get us further.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Anyways, that's why I was getting it.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Cool. So with that said, we were talking about the future of software

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and you were talking about scoping this out so that it's valuable for people you are talking about.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So with this new light, I can say that let's not think about it in terms of what would be the scope

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that would be valuable.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's talk about the whole thing.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then in retrospect, we can choose that.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hey, this is the part that.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So do you think in your organization the practices that you're following is effective by doing X, Y and Z?

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What if I can show you that's not the case and you could do this instead?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What if like which kind of teams should use flow based programming?

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or rather same thing about are you a hardware organization

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and you're following the software practices of build fast, break fast kind of approach?

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you know that in hardware that doesn't work so well as it does for software?

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And they're not the same thing.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hardware, you should plan more better in those kind of ways.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Like the concepts that we kind of take readily, but not necessarily are true for.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It doesn't apply everywhere or new light that can be shed on something.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We can then pick those topics out and put them on a funnel for like can be presented better in a sense,

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
not part of the only the real time discussion that we had.

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So with that said, there doesn't need to be in my mind a certain kind of boundary that we need to follow or maintain here.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This can be extreme raw stream of thoughts, as long as it's not something that is a boundary bordering on illegal or something.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't think there's any problem with that.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Even that's a restriction.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I would eventually want to get lifted, but not possible now.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So I'm sticking with it.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I think I want to double down back on the build fast, break fast.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is that what you said?

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So that is like fast iteration approach, right?

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So it doesn't have to be perfect.

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Build something.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's see how well does it work if something doesn't put another layer of bandaid on top of it.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And now it does.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And now it's better.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, we can say that.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I want to start there because I feel like it's something that talks very close to my heart.

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
As in the issue that I lost your video.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, it's fine.

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm just switching. Sorry about that.

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No worries.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So the build fast, break fast or like ship quick and every other such phrases that software development has gathered.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And there is one fundamental issue with those approaches.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And this is way more overlooked than I would like to have.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that's I guess just one area that I wanted to begin with.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And just to pick on why build the base, like spend time building the base is important, even though it looks like you are building very slow.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're not shipping at all.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The difference between the two is if you chart to build fast and break fast sort of iteration, you get from zero to ten very fast.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can do that. Right.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But in the process, what slows down as your breakages happen?

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Because you're breaking your like what build fast break fast kind of translates to is where you don't worry about backwards compatibility of a project because you're like I am shipping it.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I can ship all client instances.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Everybody will be on the same version and things would go perfectly like as if you've solved the distribution problem.

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So this is one facet of it.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But the other facet of it is as your patches come in.

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
As more and more patches come in, your builds become slower and slower and slower.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So you are breaking fast, but you're not building fast enough.

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And over time, the rate of your iteration slows down.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And which means any new feature at some point you make statements like this, that this system was not designed to accommodate those issues in the first place.

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So you have hit a threshold condition.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But most of the time, if we really dissect that issue, what you will find is it's not that the system was not built.

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's that the system has had so many patchworks, so many band-aids.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It is standing on such a thin edge that any one more, you know, like when the Jenga is like that full last break will collapse it.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You know, it kind of gets to that stage.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So build fast and break fast essentially slows down your iterative pace over time.

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So how do you then go back to building a foundation?

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What should that foundation do for you?

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you're starting off a new project, if you're starting as a new software project, you're starting off on a new learning whatever.

195
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But let's stick to the software project area right now.

196
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you focus on building out the systems first that help you iterate fast in the future, there is a difference between the two.

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
In build fast and break fast, even though you're saying that we want to iterate fast and ship fast,

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you're often not taking care of other things that break because you say that this is collateral cost at acceptable to breaking.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And in the other format, you are saying that, OK, I know systems will break.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Things do software breaks, there are errors.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But what I want is to have the ability to iterate very fast, ship out and update very fast, no matter how pervasive the issue may be.

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Or if I'm building something new, how can I ship on that?

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Which means as a software team, especially let's say you're building a new SaaS product, build out your platform team first,

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
make your any core runtime, any core technical decisions, lock them in.

205
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Make sure that you have evaluated things that you want to work with.

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So, for example, any standard SaaS, you don't want to bicker about what database to use.

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You definitely don't want to bicker about how should the schema be structured if you're building a new service.

208
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You don't want to bicker about what should be the API standard or that, hey, I want APIs to be built this way,

209
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
which means there are certain standardization, which is what forms the base.

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But that is the thing that you tend to first that your first shipment is to your consumer is the internal team,

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which they can use to then iterate fast on top of it.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So, what that does is pretty much the blue line on this chart is it takes you off to a slow start.

213
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But then you get to this point of incremental returns where cumulative returns start pushing you broader.

214
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And with such a system, the key line can pretty much be open, scalable, community-driven processes,

215
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
making giant improvements right after that threshold kicks off because you're not stuck in the same loop.

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You're not breaking as much anymore.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, going gets easier as you get going, essentially.

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So, the reasons are labeled R and K.

219
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I'll come back to that.

220
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There is a very good reason with all that you explained about how putting more time in figuring stuff out works well

221
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and why you think so and why I think so, but many people don't.

222
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It boils down to a very different theory that they don't seem coherent, but they're absolutely exactly that way,

223
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
which is why in the hardware industry, if you go for that R selection strategy, you would fail miserably.

224
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You have to do K.

225
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You have to do K.

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And in the software industry, the way the gratification is modeled, if you are fast to market,

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
albeit with stupider products, and you got some people subscribed to that IDR model,

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
now when your better version comes out, they already are subscribed to it.

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So you have more as in thing to play with.

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And you only can get more people out of that because your product can only get better in a sense.

231
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And for anybody new coming in, if they go with the K model, by the time they get to the crossover point,

232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:10,000
chances are that trend has already surpassed, that entire market has been utilized.

233
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Now, that is true and that was true, however, in a time where R and K followed a very different timeline.

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And the K selection actually needed a long time to actually be competitive.

235
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Now, with the new kind of tools, you can make K itself faster.

236
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can plan faster, plan better, and actually cross the limit set points very aggressively than before,

237
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
whereas R will always get stuck at some point and get like the going will get tough for it as it continues going forward

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
because it didn't start with enough groundwork to sustain that.

239
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It becomes a jenga block.

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So now those two curves follow two different styles of evolution.

241
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
One is a tortoise laying 500 eggs and basically leaving it be going over.

242
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Think of those 500 eggs as 500 different ideas built for breakfast.

243
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Half of them would not even make it to the sea for the first time ever.

244
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Some of them would, one of them might, but laying more number of eggs

245
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
gives the opportunity for maximum variance or variable, variabilities to be explored, which one gets selected.

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So if you're trying to make a selection, like which kind of selection would work better, that works very well in evolution.

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Lay more eggs. Don't worry much about it.

248
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Move on to your life. Next year, come back and lay 500 more eggs.

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's it. Life is easy. You don't have to do much.

250
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Whereas if you go up the food chain or like the, how do you say, like the success chain of the evolutionary species, what humans do,

251
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
like we spend our 18 years, first 18 years being kid.

252
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Like not only that we have, we like something can things can go wrong.

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There are other entities will make sure things don't go wrong.

254
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They will give you that lower hanging part that you haven't built up yet.

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
They'll give you that will make you get you to that catch up point where you can cross over.

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Now you are adult. Now go make break boundaries up to you.

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Right. So that happens only in species who have found out their niche or the selection has already been selected.

258
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Say, for example, sharks don't evolve as much as other species.

259
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They have been they have been formed before dinosaurs.

260
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They're still there. Right.

261
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The reason being they have found their niche.

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Even if you go for a homogenous species, like snakes, for example, two different species of snakes can behave to completely different.

263
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
A king cobra actually is a viviparous, not viviparous.

264
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So it gives birth to baby snakes, which is awkward and weird.

265
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It takes care of those baby snakes like is not expected out of snake like their lowest form of reptiles in a sense.

266
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right. Why is that the case? If you think about it, OK, what does it do in a food chain?

267
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It eats other snakes is basically breaking that boundary.

268
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That green set point is basically transcending over what it is said to be.

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's like a ratatouille. You're said to be a mouse, but you have become a chef.

270
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's almost like that way. If you need to break that kind of boundary, if you have to like set any kind of sublime,

271
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
like become something that other people perceive as sublime, then you have to go the case selection mechanism.

272
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You cannot have excellence going by the art selection, but the art selection is what gives you the tools to work with for the case selection.

273
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So the entire whole point that I was trying to build is that not one can be thrown out for the sake of the other.

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
However, one needs to find the balance is neither of those things alone is sufficient.

275
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
If you get too comfortable in your skin in the case selection model, one certain asteroid will come and wipe your entire not only species,

276
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:49,000
but entire ecology out because you are too comfortable being large and big and breathing too much oxygen and cannot burrow under the ground.

277
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So that's what ends up happening. So if you want to sustain and survive, you need both.

278
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
However, you need to pick and choose the balance how much of innovation of art you want and how much planning of key you want.

279
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Usually that balance, usually whenever people say something is good, we have a tendency to do only that, like overdo those things.

280
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So completely like off the salt, like would never touch salt ever again, that kind of thing.

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We tend to overdo that. So those kind of practices is where the challenge is like.

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
How do you think? First of all, do you see the point that I was trying to make?

283
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Is did I explain it enough or did I like not explaining the screen back?

284
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
As in you just share it again.

285
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh, OK. I just I crossed it as in I didn't save it.

286
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Didn't save it. OK. Yeah.

287
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So anyhow, I was back as in I can.

288
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I was showing it back as in I I stopped showing.

289
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's what you mentioned.

290
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And if you can share it again. Oh, sorry.

291
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No, I like I have to draw it again. Yeah.

292
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So the thing that I was trying to get to, and I think you did a very good segue to it is that the time it takes, right?

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Because one of the things to look at and again, whether the key or the art flow, it depends on what your destination is.

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Like if you are doing something that is really wrong, then because there are chances that the results of your computation of the information that you need won't be available for a few years.

295
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So there is a way to get whatever.

296
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So the key curve can take the advantage of varying time, a specific milestone or a specific inflection point to be precise exists.

297
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Now, if you want to actually maximize this area, I would have asked you to shade the RK intersection.

298
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes, because the best way to then combine both because you need the short bursts of acceleration.

299
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Again, if you look at agile processes and scrum, you always have this concept of spikes, right, which are your exploratory area.

300
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The very interesting pattern that emerges when you chart it this way is you kind of get to a tangential like a diagonal double helix that forms as a result of the constant intersections of the R and K lines.

301
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And which is your step function.

302
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Tick tock model.

303
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's called tick tock tick tock model.

304
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And they've introduced it for their processor generation.

305
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
One shrinks the die size.

306
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
One increases the number of processor.

307
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And the point I'm trying to say is that the double helical structure exists in nature in exactly these kind of situations that where there is a contention between the energy usage and time.

308
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Or efficiency over time.

309
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or there is this constant correlation because there are two things that are time orbiting around each other.

310
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So what this would look like if I am to map this to physics, if this would look like a binary star system pacing through the galaxy or through a universe, the route that they will chart.

311
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The important thing is that your R and K have bounded like they have attraction towards each other.

312
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If your R and K separate, if they diverge, then you at some point would choose a certain way.

313
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And that's fine.

314
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Like divergence is also good in some areas.

315
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like let's say you have you have hit that area where you know that you found your niche and you want to carry on on the K trajectory.

316
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's OK to then detach from the R trajectory.

317
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But what would soon happen is after a while, the same patterns would emerge because again, this is fundamentally a step function.

318
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You have to flat line and then you have to climb again, which is why I was saying that the best thing to then do is look at how do you combine innovation?

319
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So that if you shared that area between R and K, the reason I was saying that what that is, it's your safety margin.

320
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That R cannot exceed a certain boundary before K catching up.

321
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So if you then just continue on that front, it it also means that those are stable.

322
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
When you wrote E here, what was your E?

323
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Entropy, but energy fits just fine.

324
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
OK, I went to energy.

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I was like something doesn't feel right.

326
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So you see what you're saying that, yeah.

327
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I am saying the classic dualist philosophy.

328
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I got it.

329
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I see it that way, by the way.

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But this is not the first time.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So you can go on this double helical process, but the double helical grows over time.

332
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What to watch out for is yet if E is entropy, this makes all the more sense.

333
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That this curve should kind of be a linear and mildly.

334
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
If you chart the intersection points of R and K and plot that, it should be nearly linear.

335
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah, it would be.

336
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:39,000
In fact, the best equilibrium, you are doing it perfect when it is a perfect 45 degree angle on the E by T chart.

337
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This one that is a perfect charting the growth of entropy over time and having some points where you are merging back.

338
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So that's quite a lot of theory.

339
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But then how does this boil down to what we are talking of building the base that are these discussions are pretty much the R line.

340
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That it's the upward curve of the R line.

341
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And at some point, if we continue along the R line, we are going to not produce anything that is worthwhile and we are going to flatten out.

342
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
There won't be newer ideas.

343
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The K line here is something that is taking whatever is there, creating that baseline, meeting up to meet like a publishing point.

344
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now, when let's let's mark that as like E1T1 sort of, let's say the first inflection point.

345
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
First, let me mark this inflection point, this point.

346
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah. So this after this first inflection point, something interesting is happening.

347
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
If you notice, the R is sort of taking a period of recovery where it is catching up.

348
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But in that point, the K line actually has a lot to catch up on.

349
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So that publishing the feedback and everything comes in some sort of stabilized delivery.

350
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Meanwhile, this needs to build up.

351
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So one interesting, I mean, this is, of course, hand drawn.

352
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But when you plot it, what's going to happen is your R would never dip below its current Y levels.

353
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Your R would flatten and then go up again.

354
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So these the P here is one of those key inflection release points.

355
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Whenever you are at this P, each time you can take a call on whether for further like which direction to go next.

356
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Because from there, you can choose key. I want to do another burst of development.

357
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But in any case, it ends up looking like a double helical pattern.

358
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Which is why I do not promote like personally to go for either one of those approach.

359
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And if you notice, we haven't been doing either one of those approach by itself.

360
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What we did is that we kept the idea generation factory.

361
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
This R as it is untouched. Go ahead, do your thing.

362
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Right. At some point you will hit a ceiling or something like that.

363
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No more ideas coming out. I don't know when that will happen.

364
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If that does, but we are not tying it with success of the whole thing to that only.

365
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We're saying, you know, let's talk about how do we classify that categorize that?

366
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
How do you set up the platform in a way that part of the discussion was the case selection.

367
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Right. So we did both at the same time.

368
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And that is the ideal approach to go on about it is because how at ease both those like the two parts of the double helical structure is with with itself.

369
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So the moment when we come to the inflection point where the distribution mechanism is having same amount of success as the idea generation one.

370
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So idea generation has told enough and the distribution mechanism has reason enough to come to the point.

371
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That's when we have to switch our mindset about, hey, do we need to cover more ground, more areas that we can cover?

372
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And this mechanism of distribution that works is just let more subscribers come in.

373
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Whatever people were talking about or listening to, let them talk about it, listen to that and think it will keep on going there.

374
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It will flatline much later, much after.

375
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
By that time, let's think about whether there are more ideas to talk about.

376
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Right. So that way, it will keep on shifting perspective.

377
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We have to put a little more here, a little more effort there, a little more effort there at the cost of putting a little less effort here or there.

378
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And that way, like they will go back and forth.

379
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But this idea identifying those inflection points is where the actual.

380
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So if I had to talk about like how tech CEOs or basically CXOs should think about these kind of things, it would be.

381
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Not only them, for anybody for that matter, it makes the same sense.

382
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But how do your priorities, the two aspects of it, where do they meet and at which point you should decide that you need to shift gears in either one of those?

383
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because this battle between.

384
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Have you watched WALL-E, the movie?

385
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
There is a space thing where WALL-E and EVA goes in a spiral.

386
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
That's exactly what it ends up looking if it is not drawn poorly on MS Paint.

387
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So that's that's what I was getting at.

388
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So that's what it will constantly change and shift.

389
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And that is a good good way. No case selection is perfect case selection for forever.

390
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The world, the reality, the universe would put blockers in your in front of you that you would need to rethink about it.

391
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You need to shift perspective and change up some of the parameters to make it fit better and know our selection is going to be better as well.

392
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But yes, by definition, it will flatten out if you don't start to reorganize that.

393
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I have so many examples for this. I don't know.

394
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Can you name the green plane?

395
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So that is how the progress looks like from zoomed out.

396
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Put a marker to it so that I can refer to it.

397
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So it's P, the progress. I thought P was the point.

398
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, OK. So that I should have called the point P as like, OK, wait, infection.

399
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So it's it can be I. I don't I don't want to acknowledge the infection.

400
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I said just name the name the axis. If that's P, then that's fine.

401
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Now, the important thing to remember is why in our discussions,

402
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
at least some of these places where these things work out,

403
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
because if you map this to the functioning of a good product and development team in most software organizations,

404
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
the R is your product management who are going out,

405
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
exploring possibilities, coming back to you with arguments, the K catches up.

406
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Then there is the R going down below the K is the period where product management is

407
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
gathering feedback for something that has been shipped.

408
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Meanwhile, there is a constant thing that is going on, like full pleasure development going on.

409
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What's going on? Because by then you are validating at one point that goes and then you again come back out.

410
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Right. So the green, what is important in this is if you want to independently

411
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
control the rate of R and K, you might fail.

412
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It might look like it is intuitive that I can, of course, turn.

413
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But no, the important thing is the green line, the P plane that wherever you are going,

414
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the P plane should target there, which means if you are going somewhere,

415
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you don't have a lot of time, your P plane will be far more sloped upwards so that you reach at the end of the point.

416
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But what this mainly looks like. Yeah.

417
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So it's basically matter and anti-matter in a sense, like how much it goes above the progress line.

418
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It also you also have to have that much below the progress.

419
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Anyways, yeah, one of the things I want to.

420
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The reason I said this is important is I said about the double helical structure.

421
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So if you just draw the chart, the distance from the like the delta R with the delta from P at each point,

422
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and then you do delta K from P, you should never do R to K as a straight thing.

423
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You should always branch off from P. So your P is kind of ideal where I want to go to.

424
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So that is if you then look at two stars revolving around each other, running around the galaxy.

425
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If you can plot their movement, you will get the orbit of both the suns.

426
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Right. Yes. And that is the important factor that where is the thing going?

427
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Because the way you nudge this system to go in any other direction is by changing where that green would end up.

428
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Right. So basically, the green is the barycenter of those two like two body system is the barycenter where other two things are basically revolving around.

429
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So in this setup, over time, it would be considered as access, essentially.

430
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah. Now, why this is more important is you need to look at this.

431
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's of course over T. So it's a it's a state machine slash motion snapshot, whatever.

432
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The critical thing to know is this is a very simplified version.

433
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This is a very simplified version. This is a like simplified in the sense this is a reduced version.

434
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In real world, you would have at least three or four such accesses pulling along each other.

435
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But you would probably be able to call them as R1, R2 and K1, K2.

436
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You can broadly group them in these two opposing forces categories.

437
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The reason is it's like imagine all of Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter.

438
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What does that look like that you have that many groups like things going on?

439
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Right. So one of the common things that comes up in most product,

440
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,000
especially the sort of software product who are more tuned to community that they want to take in community feedback,

441
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is there is a friction between internally on should I prioritize community feedback or should I prioritize what my CEO wants?

442
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And that presents a very weird but very difficult to solve friction as well.

443
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And one way to address that is again be true to your T plane.

444
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If you have a clear enough idea of where that is, you can just map a community feedback on the distance like chart the delta R from P.

445
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
See if it is within acceptable range, in which case treat is just as the same as any internal team member has suggested it.

446
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Right. That it is on that curve where I see delta R reducing over time till it intersects with K.

447
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So we speak maths.

448
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes. In essence, it's very it will take too many words to explain otherwise.

449
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But what I'm trying to say is just map the functions.

450
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So you don't want to start with R alone or K alone.

451
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Then the part that comes in is once you identify this, you realize the importance of iterations.

452
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Fast iterations on this plane would mean more frequent intersections between R and P, R and K.

453
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Slower iterations would mean longer durations, but slower iterations have a challenge key.

454
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You might have difficulty the longer R and K have diverged, the longer it might take to converge them back.

455
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So you want to place a limit limiter function on what is the maximum distance possible for R before the K function triggers an upward curve.

456
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Right. For the people listening to this and being a little bit.

457
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't know what was the right term.

458
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I would like to just break this down.

459
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll give an example, because sometimes I've seen what works out of the exoteric discussions is that an example immediately grabs the attention back.

460
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So I will give an example. Chip vendors, right?

461
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
That's probably it's not a rocket science in that sense.

462
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's actually more complicated than rocket science.

463
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It is super complicated stuff.

464
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Probably the one of the most complicated things we do as a species is producing chips.

465
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Now, there are always a lot more factors that gets into this and creates this to be not as simple as that.

466
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
This graph, two different factors.

467
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But if you try hard enough, you can still always make a multi-body problem into a two-body problem.

468
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And this is a model that Intel used to follow and now still now follows is when their odd generation of chipsets like chips, 15th generation, 13th generation, 11th generation also,

469
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
they follow a particular kind of R and different kind of K or basically the phase shift essentially.

470
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What is R here would become K here in that kind of way.

471
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So what they do, they have boiled it down to like, we need to do two things in order to give or provide people with more amount of computing power in the same or similar kind of package.

472
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We need to do two things. We need to lower the size of the silicon as in the transistors that we have and pack more into the same time.

473
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So how about we put more innovation and both those things, they are not two separate things that are happening separately.

474
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:32,000
What is happening is that from the moment of their team is done with 11th generation, that team starts working towards the 13th generation.

475
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Their objective can just be how do we pack more chips into that same layout, same size, whatever the LGA size is.

476
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And whatever the moment 12th generation are done, they would move to 14th generation.

477
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
How do I produce as in create the transitions themselves are smaller, right?

478
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In that sense, they create double 2x the phase then because if you see about this, this graph eventually comes down and meets somewhere over here.

479
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Then when it starts back again, this point and this point are practically the same point.

480
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So basically 2x that phase then perceived phase that becomes its original pace.

481
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So every two generation, they're doing the exact same thing all over again, starting new going.

482
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But for the first part of it, one team is in experimental experimentation mode.

483
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The other team is in production mode.

484
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The next phase, the other team is in the experimentation mode and this team is in production.

485
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And that works so well for them.

486
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
They're sticking by it.

487
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And even though AMD threatened them with a very different kind of innovation where they're like, we don't actually want to even build the whole thing in one day.

488
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So to do that, it's much, much easier to build them in smaller pieces and put them back together.

489
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So I want to do that chiplet design.

490
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So at that point, what do you do?

491
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You can just split off like, hey, there's a tick tock model teams that we have.

492
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:21,000
How about if the tick tock model teams as one, R or K, and the chiplet team as R and K, R or K, depending on which phase they are in.

493
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So you can make any time any multi-body problem into two-body problem.

494
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So one team is going to look into how the chiplets can be made.

495
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The other team is going to look like always how I can make the chiplets themselves more denser.

496
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So in that sense, what is in the ending up happening is that no matter how complicated the system is, it's not only this does not only apply to a very simple or theoretical only situations.

497
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You can make it apply anywhere, wherever you can perceive a duality.

498
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You can perceive a pull or push and pull tug of war between two different forces.

499
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Do I do this or do I do that?

500
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
This should actually help you out with that.

501
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I lost your video feed.

502
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:14,000
All right.

503
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Right. I don't know where else I was going with this.

504
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Should I be starting to think about a better analogy or example?

505
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I kind of think like the chiplet design or the chip vendor kind of example is not genuine.

506
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think we can just probably follow because we were talking future software development.

507
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This is one place to come back to when we were saying that like the base when we went into this discussion.

508
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Is there any supplement that follows that?

509
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
This I don't know, but it's something that is visible and like I'm not saying somebody explicitly follows.

510
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm not saying that.

511
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah. So the only thing to remember is that while you said that you can break down a multi body problem into a two body problem in most cases,

512
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:21,000
but there will be edge cases where you are stuck with a three body problem because you start dividing like decomposing and you end up with three fundamental elements because like the lowest number you can't divide three.

513
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So what goes on in that kind of a situation is you are presented with a slightly more chaotic world.

514
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The two body world is far more deterministic.

515
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The three body world is extremely chaotic.

516
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And science fiction, plugway, three body problem and all if you just like just that three body problem itself is one of the things to geek out on.

517
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's such a beautiful mathematical problem and social problem.

518
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Anyway, you want to put it right.

519
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But what happens is and I think this will come up more.

520
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,000
This will become more and more relevant as complexities of software development increase because there are more things riding on it.

521
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And I have experienced this in some form.

522
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Like I said, it becomes a three body problem because in a traditional software development organization, you cannot always compare things back down to two, especially when you are more community folks.

523
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And this is something I've seen happen with the more progressive software organizations.

524
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Because in a traditional software org, you have your like product design, development, management, whatever as one function, you have development as a function.

525
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So you sort of have two broader sections.

526
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But then the moment you bring in.

527
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So what these two teams do with user feedback is the user feedback is split into their separate buckets, right?

528
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
That is how you are breaking down a complex system into a two body system that when user feedback is coming in, you are saying, is this a product feedback?

529
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Is this sort of engineering feedback?

530
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And it kind of you are channelizing.

531
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But what happens when you bring in a community as a first class citizen in this process?

532
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And say, for example, the software, the way more of the community focused, even for profit companies, the software, those who, you know, actually take community input seriously.

533
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And the reason you see the open source world and especially partially commercial commercial open source worlds be such a tricky minefield to access, also to build and maintain, because at some point you take decisions which are harmful for the community.

534
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
At some point, the community asks something which is detrimental to the earnings or the sustainability of the project.

535
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So then it is still not that difficult.

536
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It is just one other access which might have chaotic influence on others.

537
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So at that point, you have two choices.

538
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Do you want to then merge the community like whenever you start with a three body problems, essentially validating them that if it is not three stars that are orbiting each other, in which case, well, good luck.

539
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But if you have some control of the system, you want to merge one towards the other.

540
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
For example, are your internal stakeholders?

541
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
In fact, in fact, you just said that screw it if it's stars.

542
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Good luck with that.

543
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That's exactly what is going to happen.

544
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I was just going to come back to giving you the same solution.

545
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
That's exactly what is going to end up happening.

546
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What else do you think is going to end up happening?

547
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah, so eventually, I mean, our nearest star neighbors.

548
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, like Centauri system, so Proxima Centauri, so Alpha Centauri.

549
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's a three body problem.

550
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yes.

551
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The smaller one and the larger one.

552
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So the three body problem series is based on that star system.

553
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh, I see.

554
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I see.

555
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So but the very interesting thing that happens is eventually systems coalesce given long enough time.

556
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But what if you don't want to give that long enough time?

557
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The immediate answer to especially those building software where you want to involve the community is do not keep a distinction between your internal stakeholders and external stakeholders.

558
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Everybody is a stakeholder for the thing that has been built.

559
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You have the best keywords that are probably on your payroll who are your internal stakeholders.

560
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So then you have moved that, you know, the graph of requirements instead of having a CEO to fight and a community to fight.

561
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You're like community.

562
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
CEO is just a community representative or the community is just an extension of my internal team.

563
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Now, I want to really push that model.

564
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I have not had much success in coalescing those because individual egos kind of still, you know, border.

565
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But what would it look like to build an org where you, I mean, what would it look like?

566
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:28,000
We have seen this orgs built, but reducing the chaos in that system, coalescing them better such that the community is a homogeneous entity.

567
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Right.

568
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So one challenge that I've seen, the part that bothered me the most,

569
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:44,000
which is why I'm trying to put my best foot forward to not piece of people and try to reach people is that most people in position or power,

570
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:54,000
the way our selection worked out for them is that were they very aggressively assertive, were they very conscientious?

571
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And so those are the things that things that propelled them forward and put in a position of power are not.

572
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Have this put enough thought meditating about a certain topic, validating whether that's correct, true or false?

573
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
No, not that. Right.

574
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So what ends up happening is that the people who needs this kind of help the most are least likely to seek it

575
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
or least likely to even be open to it if you even if you hand it over to them.

576
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So the way I'm starting to think about is that not how do we distribute,

577
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:42,000
but rather finding out who are those people or how do we get those people to put to a place where they would be open to taking these ideas in the first place.

578
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Do you think this discussion that we are having, most, many or most people who are running or having a team that they need to run better,

579
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:03,000
they have all the intentions to make it run better, but do they have the intent capacity and the availability or being a position?

580
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
How do you commit a crime?

581
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
You need to do three things. You need to be in a place. You need to have the intent and you have to need to have the capability.

582
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So I'm saying that can you find the trifecta of people in a mass scale?

583
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You don't. You find very rare, few samples and those samples are already kind of jaded out of the system.

584
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Take yourself for an example.

585
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:33,000
The only reason you are so motivated to talk about these things is because how much it bothered you when you are or were in the system.

586
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Right.

587
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
How do we find those people?

588
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
How do we find how those people, instead of being jaded out of the system,

589
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:50,000
how they can actually be part of the system and drive that change from the inside instead of like,

590
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm out of here instead of that.

591
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I think that is probably the best bet that we have got because you cannot make a horse out of an ass.

592
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:12,000
At least I'm open to be proven wrong, but I have tried and I have failed miserably every time I tried to go that route.

593
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But it is better. It is more effortful.

594
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
If sorry, it is more.

595
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:30,000
What do you call that thing? Fulfilling. To find out the horses, even if lower in number and then train them to become the horses that you want them to be.

596
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You will get a lot of kicks. That is fine.

597
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But eventually it will get to that position and then you will count that as a success.

598
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That's much better than spending enormous amount of time pretending this donkey is a horse and can replace a horse.

599
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's not what it was. That's how I think about this whole thing.

600
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Who should we talk to about this kind of stuff?

601
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
That may not be the right answer to the question that you have asked.

602
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But if you can touch on the way, how would you want to go on about it?

603
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Then I probably can add some more thoughts about it.

604
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:14,000
This was my immediate, very like deep seated or rooted kind of fast, fast answer, essentially, not the nuanced answer.

605
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I understand that.

606
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
The way I want to go about it is.

607
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Not by starting to look for.

608
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But instead, take these things as frameworks.

609
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
These can be packaged as frameworks.

610
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Anybody who's in a scenario, so let's say this applies.

611
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
To a certain way of building structuring an org.

612
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Then what would those principles be?

613
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And I'm kind of drawing in from how the orbit framework went from being just a brilliant, like very beautiful abstract idea to an implementable framework.

614
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And the idea, the first thing that you do in any such implementation is you map to existing concepts, which means if I were to take any organization.

615
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Produce this chart based on their activities.

616
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
What does my RNK planes look like?

617
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Do they even intersect?

618
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Do they even exist?

619
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Is one of the first things.

620
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So being able to.

621
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So I would actually look at this as a framework, publish this as a framework.

622
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And with like framework applied to specific scenarios.

623
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And just going detailed into some of those maybe that if you are and then speaking to personas, right?

624
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That how to apply this if you are a junior software developer, how to apply this if you're a senior developer, how to apply this if you are a new people manager, how to apply this if you are an architect.

625
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Because at each position, at each levels of power, there are different areas that somebody can influence in.

626
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,000
But the importance of such a framework comes when it gives a handbook for the entire power structure.

627
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So that whoever is bringing this in into an organization, let's say they find something which they feel.

628
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Let's say me as a manager, as a new people manager, find something that can benefit from.

629
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But what happens is when I bring something in, it's also on me to help others learn, others implement.

630
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And that becomes one of the burnout points for somebody like me who wants to do good, who wants to build something from the inside.

631
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But if I got something which not just told me what it looks like for me, what are the things that I need to do, as much as what does it look like throughout the entire power structure, sort of the framework that helps them see at their views.

632
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That immediately becomes a lot more useful.

633
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And you then see different levels of adoption.

634
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And whatever levels of adoption an org goes through, sometimes the impact stays limited to one team in a larger org, like one team of four or five members or 10 members.

635
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Over time, over a few quarters or few iterations, what starts happening is other teams start seeing that this team is doing something different where they have become more stable.

636
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
They are shipping software better, they are more predictable.

637
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So what is it that they are doing?

638
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:43,000
If the answer at that point is not specific people, but a certain way of work that they have been able to adapt, then immediately there is that viral proof based distribution that happens.

639
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So what I'm then saying is the way I would like to bring this to the masses is by looking at the layers and seeing what would be that implementation, and maybe even looking at this from a few lenses.

640
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:07,000
For example, let's say the future of software development is one, then building an organization that follows some of those principles being one.

641
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I kind of see this as a handbook with use cases.

642
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
One specific example.

643
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Let me see if I can find I'll share with you what I mean.

644
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But this is this is the direction.

645
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Now, what I mean with this is that with the theoretical framework in place, the people to talk to are those who have tried applying it.

646
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Get that feedback and sort of build from there as well.

647
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
What I'm not sure about is if that is the work that we want to do in mass.

648
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Or is this more of a blog post series.

649
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I've been trying to match the match the suggestion up with my experience of exact same situation, which has happened.

650
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And my expectation was what you said.

651
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:09,000
People see that, hey, some other team are having more success or equal success with different practices or sense more success with sympathy.

652
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
What is it that that is different about them?

653
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And why is it that way?

654
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And let's learn from it.

655
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Let's implement that.

656
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The reality is much more grimmer than what?

657
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
What would that idealistic viewpoint would suggest?

658
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
First of all, nobody would go through like want to look into that mirror or acknowledge that that somebody else is doing.

659
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So I'll give you a more tangible, actual and real.

660
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So a team practicing agile and another team is not one team is completely into procuring.

661
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Procuring high quality talents, letting them do whatever they want.

662
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And they have a good backlog management of like, hey, here are the things that are a priority for our organization, for the bigger goal of our organization.

663
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
We need to get all of these things done.

664
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You're not bound to do one thing or the other, but whatever you pick and choose.

665
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Try to be successful at it, like implement that successfully.

666
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Don't leave it at half as way.

667
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You will have to produce enough result out of it that we know that you've spent your time with it.

668
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Even if you fail and you want to hand it over to somebody else, that's fine.

669
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So that's one approach.

670
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And the other one is like the normal baseline run of the mill agile.

671
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's not even that the what is the what does the book say kind of is the normal practice of agile.

672
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So that's what is happening.

673
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Which team do you think is over the course of time producing better result?

674
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And I'm not going to give you the answer here.

675
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I don't want to sound biased to anybody who is listening.

676
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't want people to tune out there because it doesn't match up with their expectation.

677
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The thing is, after over two years of that happening, one team is doing like sustaining very well at low overhead of operation and having generating very good results overall.

678
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,000
But the other team or teams are not really ready to learn from that at all.

679
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:32,000
They don't want to acknowledge that has anything to do with their lack of momentum has anything to do with the practices they're following or rather the time they're ending up spending doing things that may or may not contribute to the overall progress of the organization.

680
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
They simply would not acknowledge that in the first place.

681
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Improvement comes after you acknowledge that, hey, something can be improved.

682
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So in that sense, if you take it from there, I would argue you would be the first blocker that you face is convincing them that they need to do something differently because they are not doing it well.

683
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Solutions are easier.

684
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Accepting you need a solution is the hardest part.

685
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Whatever I've seen, and it's kind of heartbreaking like those are the parts that actually I get mad like I'm usually not.

686
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I take everything just most of the time, but those are things like real wastage of potential and people choosing to ignore facts, just because their worldview does not align with that.

687
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Those are the things that grind my gear very hard, essentially.

688
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I'll stop there. I know that I might rant a long while if I just if I'm allowed to get started with this, I'm going to stop there.

689
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And, yeah, that's it.

690
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I shared the two links there is actually the exit to community.

691
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
One of those things pretty close to my heart.

692
01:02:49,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But the way these people have applied this, it was one of the example that I was trying to show is one of the ways I would like to, you know, work on it.

693
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:11,000
The core idea behind exit to community is how can we build organizations such that they serve the end community that you are using.

694
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And then for startup founders or for people building new organizations instead of targeting IPO, which is like the two common forms of exit that you are either acquired or you go IPO.

695
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:33,000
This is a third alternative to that, which is saying you plan for an exit to community and there are a bunch of tools, a bunch of things that you can use.

696
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:47,000
They also have many such organizations, all of them, of course, smaller scale and exit to community focused organizations tend to be niche focused because it's kind of like identifying a niche user base,

697
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:55,000
building for them in the hope that eventually all of them will take ownership of this entire organization.

698
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So which fits very well into how you and I think of initiators that for us, a maturity is when it has gotten community acceptance such that we can move on to the next.

699
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
In fact, spin up multiple side by side.

700
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Its existence does not rely on the parents taking care of it on a daily basis.

701
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Exactly. Exactly. Like the kids have grown up.

702
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But the difference is this produces far more focused, far more impactful work because you are not trying to chase artificial money.

703
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
You are always focused on sustainability.

704
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And that is how things would go. So I gave that as an example.

705
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I think this is a fantastic example. I love it.

706
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I went to the I went to the links and for the people watching the stream, they would have seen that because that's the one that will be shown there in my screen capture.

707
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Right. So they would have seen it already. I went to the base.

708
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I didn't share it. I was going through that about browser window.

709
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Understood. So that is the idea behind.

710
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I mean, in fact, exit to community exhibits this tendency, you know, that you are never moving too far from your green medium.

711
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And you are balancing innovation and sustainability.

712
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Right. Eventually to a delivery point.

713
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:27,000
No matter how you explain it, the baseline of that is playing that infinite game versus finite game where people are exiting from with money.

714
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They're playing a finite game. They have to win somewhere.

715
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
They have to put it on an objective scale of this much, that much, et cetera.

716
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But the moment you're exiting the community, you are ensuring survival of something that is bigger than the support that you can provide.

717
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Like, how long can you stay within the game and how long can you, along with a mind share of a whole other multiple layers of people,

718
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
sticking to that would provide it or give it runway would be completely different.

719
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
The sustainability would be completely different and make a lot of order of magnitude different or bigger, essentially.

720
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So basically you are playing an infinite game and significant a couple of orders of magnitude.

721
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
You are enabling yourself to do more stuff.

722
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That is the moment somebody would understand that from that finite infinite game perspective, you don't have to sell more stuff to it.

723
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
They immediately know how they want to play it out loud, play it out.

724
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But for most people, that's that part is not that obvious.

725
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
That choice is not that obvious.

726
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
How do you convince somebody to understand and recognize the difference between the finite and infinite game?

727
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Why chasing after simply just for money?

728
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It's not like in my mind, it's not too different than the paper clip maximizing, right?

729
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:55,000
The theoretical, the thought experiment of paper clip maximizer, rogue AI that learned, OK, how to make more paper clips out of anything and everything,

730
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
goes ahead and starts making paper clips out of anything and everything, depletes the resources, natural resources,

731
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
just makes paper clips because that's what it's trained to do.

732
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
That's what where it finds its meaning of purpose in life, essentially.

733
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Or whatever that that might be.

734
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So we by trying to maximize profit, we're being that profit maximizers in the exact same vein.

735
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So how do you convince somebody to think of it?

736
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Think of it differently.

737
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And the good thing is, the reason I pointed out is this entire like the second link that I shared, the PDF, that's the gem.

738
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
That's something to like print and keep with you.

739
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:43,000
That talks of how different levels of organizations can deal with it, with some case studies, with some ways of thinking.

740
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And, of course, unblocking some of those ways of thinking, leaving you with some more things to do.

741
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So this is one I was saying this format, like I feel like the output of all of this discussion, if this is if it is that a PDF,

742
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
really, that people like a book and also to say that you can or a booklet that you can share, publish.

743
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I think that itself has value to build.

744
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But I wanted to eventually arrive at exit to community.

745
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I'm glad I kind of came through this, because again, talking of the future of software development,

746
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:24,000
what we were trying to mention with the build fast, break fast thing, there are two considerations here.

747
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And I just touched on them.

748
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
We can move on.

749
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:38,000
The first is the current set of tooling that we have or that we're evolving to does enable you to build actually faster.

750
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
So your art cycles can be smaller.

751
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Deployment capabilities have increased so much more over the last decade that the maintaining a state of the art deployed system

752
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
is something that pretty much any small team can do today.

753
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And it's not even as crude as Ansible in 2012-13.

754
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Even Ansible feels so much better already.

755
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But the point I'm trying to say is that they have become better because they have continued on that certain line of democratization of technology.

756
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Rather, that's a cliche, but maybe it will give me a catchphrase.

757
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But the point is, it's more breaking down technology to make it more available to more and more people.

758
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And the current LLM driven AI boom that we are seeing actually introduces a very key element into that equation.

759
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
That now you do not just build fast when you break fast.

760
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Constantly saying break fast and messing with my head.

761
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:59,000
But when you actually break too often, let's say your breakages can be significantly more harmful.

762
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yes, correct.

763
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And you cannot continue using these same tools, experimenting and testing in the same way.

764
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You need a far more contained.

765
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's like if Sun was like, hey, we need to collide two particles.

766
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I just give me any random desert on Earth.

767
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Because we used to collide things.

768
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
See if I used to test cars, I used to mash cars against fast moving cars and test how they broke.

769
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You can't do the same with two photons.

770
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You can't do the same with two atoms colliding.

771
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:45,000
So what we need, though, is make sure that the breakages, make that breaking a part of your testable framework.

772
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Which means you don't optimize build often, break often or build often and disrupt often.

773
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Fast iterations.

774
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:05,000
And if you follow that line, so you would want to minimize the gap between the two.

775
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You would want the R and K lines again to coalesce as often as possible.

776
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:19,000
But know that what's going to happen with our current set of technology is the double helix.

777
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Especially if you have short iterations are going to look like bubbles strained after one another, a chain of bubbles.

778
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's not you're not going to have the gentle curve anymore.

779
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And the only reason is you're probably looking at time in a different way.

780
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
If you expand the time axis, you zoom in, you will again start seeing that curve.

781
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But now it is just slightly steeper.

782
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So what it means is short iterations, quick tests, immediate feedback is essential with the sort of systems that we are working.

783
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Because I mean, think of it as you are a crew member of the USS Discovery, which has just gained sentience.

784
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It has just come across emotion.

785
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So this started discovery season four, and then it decides to plunge towards the sun.

786
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You don't have a lot of time, right?

787
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Now, if your systems were more like, hey, take the system down one by one, examine, it's not going to work.

788
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Which means your fail saves need to take into account that the R thing can actually suddenly break out.

789
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You won't be able to bring it back in that breaking out might be your AI has gained sentience.

790
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:47,000
If you define sentience as just having emotions, however we define, let's just say it's beyond your control and beyond your control.

791
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
If you look at the two stars orbiting each other, right?

792
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
In this case, one of them decides to shoot off in another direction.

793
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You would then have two choices.

794
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Let that go.

795
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Like that ship has sailed or try to converge enough, pull it, exert enough influence to then bring that back to a meeting line.

796
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And I think this is the point I was trying to get to that why this framework actually applies.

797
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It really shows the implications of software development.

798
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Yeah, so that was very interesting, actually.

799
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So I think I like, OK, how about we keep a particular time?

800
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Maybe next week, discuss about the perception of time versus control.

801
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
How much time you need for which kind of controls, right?

802
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
On the surface, it might seem like what is there to discuss about it.

803
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But trust me, there's a lot to dig in over there.

804
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And actually, it can be it can be seen in a multitude of ways.

805
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Only part that I'm going to mention right now is that the stoic versus the will to power philosophies that you said that there are only two options.

806
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
One is.

807
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Guess I will die.

808
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Otherwise, like I know I might die.

809
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
If I sit down, I'll still die.

810
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Then why not die swinging the sword and try to make align the world to my needs, essentially.

811
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
So those both those approaches, either of those approaches can work.

812
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But depending on the best option that you've got is that never be rushed for time.

813
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The best controls that you have got is never the ones that do not rush you towards a particular set of time or time wise delivery, temporal deliveries, essentially.

814
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:54,000
That's that's going to be part of the next that that that episode when you talk about control versus time.

815
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:04,000
At any point, if you feel like you're rushed for time, it only means you haven't established your controls well enough for that.

816
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And your concerns are correct on at least the AI front is that that was true for nuclear when we found nuclear weapons and power as well in nuclear energy.

817
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
We could harness nuclear energy.

818
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
How would you going to how are you going to harness it?

819
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Controlled burn versus explosion that in itself was to the point.

820
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
In retrospect, looks like much smaller problem that you need a couple of thousand to actually wipe out humanity.

821
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So it's not not as readily of a problem.

822
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:50,000
So as we go forward as a species, we are going to cause bigger and bigger of those potential harms that we can cause to ourselves by not being mindful about that are versus scaling.

823
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
How much planning versus how much exploration can we do?

824
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And there's that. I don't think there's an answer to this.

825
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It's just that the moment any one of us lose sight over one for the other.

826
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
That's the moment something bad would happen.

827
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Essentially, it's not a question of if but when it becomes the only thing that we need to ensure is that the control and the exploration both basically go hand in hand, going back to the topic of that.

828
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So I'll stop there. And I think it's better to close the discussion as well, essentially within the limited amount of time because we need to get into the practice.

829
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So I think this, this was with the 10th, maybe we want to go a bit more into specifics in some of those areas and stuff.

830
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:52,000
So I think I can end the stream.

831
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
So in this case, we can just wrap up.

832
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Let's let's wrap it up here.

833
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
This was pretty good discussion, by the way. Thanks, anybody who's watching.

834
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I know Sumit watches it every, every week. At least that's the only feedback that I have so far.

835
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Maybe there are other people folks are watching.

836
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
If you are watching for somebody who is watching, let me or Kostov know that you're watching.

837
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:19,000
What do you think of the stream and we'll try to make that part of the process of our growth of this as well.

838
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So with that said, thanks for sticking around and see you next week.

839
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Cheers.

840
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Cutting words from you now.
